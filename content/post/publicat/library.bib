abstract = {Using a sample of 23,218. company-year observations of listed companies during the period 1980-2011, the paper investigates empirically the utility of combining accounting, market-based and macro-economic data to explain corporate credit risk. The paper develops risk models for listed companies that predict financial distress and bankruptcy. The estimated models use a combination of accounting data, stock market information and proxies for changes in the macro-economic environment. The purpose is to produce models with predictive accuracy, practical value and macro dependent dynamics that have relevance for stress testing. The results show the utility of combining accounting, market and macro-economic data in financial distress prediction models for listed companies. The performance of the estimated models is benchmarked against models built using a neural network (MLP) and against Altman's (1968) original Z-score specification. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We analyze financial constraints on R&D, where we account for heterogeneity among investments that has been neglected in previous literature. According to economic theory, investments should be distinguished by their degree of uncertainty, e.g. routine R&D versus cutting-edge R&D. Financial constraints should be more binding for cutting-edge R&D than for routine R&D. Using panel data we find that R&D spending of firms devoting a significant fraction of R&D to cutting-edge projects is curtailed by credit constraints while routine R&D investments are not. This has important policy implications with respect to the distribution of R&D subsidies in the economy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{..2020,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Martin2013a,
abstract = {Over the past few years a new buzzword has entered academic, political and public discourse: the notion of resilience, a term invoked to describe how an entity or system responds to shocks and disturbances. Although the concept has been used for some time in ecology and psychology, it is now invoked in diverse contexts, both as a perceived (and typically positive) attribute of an object, entity or system and, more normatively, as a desired feature that should somehow be promoted or fostered. As part of this development, the notion of resilience is rapidly becoming part of the conceptual and analytical lexicon of regional and local economic studies: there is increasing interest in the resilience of regional, local and urban economies. Further, resilience is rapidly emerging as an idea âwhose time has come' in policy debates: a new imperative of âconstructing' or âbuilding' regional and urban economic resilience is gaining currency. However, this rush to use the idea of regional and local economic resilience in policy circles has arguably run somewhat ahead of our understanding of the concept. There is still considerable ambiguity about what, precisely, is meant by the notion of regional economic resilience, about how it should be conceptualized and measured, what its determinants are, and how it links to patterns of long-run regional growth. The aim of this article is to address these and related questions on the meaning and explanation of regional economic resilience and thereby to outline the directions of a research agenda.},

abstract = {Doi: 10.12957/geouerj.2015.18769 This article envisages to contribute for the discussion about "exit" opportunities for the Family Grant Program, implemented by the federal government. It states that it is necessary to strengthen regional development policies in Brazil in order that program's beneficiaries, who live in poor or less dynamic regions, may have easier access to opportunities in productive activities, no longer being dependant on government aid. This text analyses the territorial distribution of such beneficiaries and demonstrates that small and medium municipalities far away from large urban centers, with bigger percentages of beneficiaries in relation to the total number of families, are also the ones that generate fewer opportunities for formal employments. Education and capacity building have been the main instruments proposed to enable the integration in productive activities of the population currently dependent on social programs. However, in the absence of institutions and policies that help create more opportunities in these poor or less dynamic regions, the only options for the beneficiaries, after receiving education and training, will be to migrate in search of jobs or continue dependant on government aid.},

The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or "product space," finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.},

abstract = {Institutional environment of a country plays an important role for innovation activities. Our results confirm that external environment of emerging countries influence the R&D investment. Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 664 firms from selected 20 emerging markets during the period of 2006â2013, we find that institutional quality has significant impact on R&D investment. The results show that government effectiveness, rule of law, and regularity quality have positive impact, while corruption and political instability have negative impact on R&D investment in the emerging markets. We also performed elasticity test to compare among the institutional factors. The results show that among the institutional determinants, corruption of a particular emerging country is found to be most important in influencing R&D investment followed by regularity quality, government effectiveness, rule of law, and political instability. These results would be helpful to investors and policy makers to assess the requirements of sustainable development. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that to attract more R&D investment as a source of sustainable development, government should ensure a sound and stable institutional environment along with strengthening other firm level factors as institutional factors are more important to explain the variation over the time and also cost effective in terms of implementation.},

abstract = {This work studies the relations between income distribution and monetary/fiscal policies using an credit-augmented version of the agent-based Keynesian model in Dosi et al. (2010). We model a banking sector and a monetary authority setting interest rates and credit lending conditions in a framework combining Keynesian mechanisms of demand generation, a Schumpeterian innovation-fueled process of growth and Minskian credit dynamics. We show that the model is able to account for a rich ensemble of empirical features underlying current and past recessions, including the impact of financial factors on the real economy, and the role in that of income distribution. We find that more unequal economies are exposed to more severe business cycles fluctuations, higher unemployment rates, and higher probability of crises. From a policy perspective, the model suggests that fiscal policies dampen business cycles, reduce unemployment and the likelihood of experiencing a huge crisis and, in some circumstances, also affect long-term growth. Furthermore, the more income distribution is skewed toward profits, the greater the effects of fiscal policies. Interest rates have instead a strong non-linear effect on macroeconomic dynamics. Tuning the interest rate when it is below a given threshold has no detectable effects. Conversely, increasing the interest rate when it is above that threshold yields lower and more volatile output growth, higher unemployment rates, and higher likelihood of crises. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Deindustrialization in debate: theses and misconceptions in the case of the Brazilian economy

Abstract
The present study aims at explaining the theoretical assumptions behind the distinct arguments in several economic approaches within the debate on Brazilian industrialization. The process of deindustrialization can occur naturally or precociously; however in the case of the Brazilian economy, there is no consensus on the type of existing deindustrialization. There is a plurality of theses about the existence, period, causes, consequences, and other factors involved in that process. The divergence or convergence of arguments among authors in this debate does not necessarily correspond to a particular theoretical line which stems from an evaluation based on the classical indicators of deindustrialization.

Key words: deindustrialization; manufacturing; exchange rate.

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called Exogenous Fitness, to calculate the Fitness of subnational entities and we apply it to the states of Brazil. In the last decade, several indices were introduced to measure the competitiveness of countries by looking at the complexity of their export basket. Tacchella et al (2012) developed a non-monetary metric called Fitness. In this paper, after an overview about Brazil as a whole and the comparison with the other BRIC countries, we introduce a new methodology based on the Fitness algorithm, called Exogenous Fitness. Combining the results with the Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPp), we look at the dynamics of the Brazilian states in the Fitness-Income plane. Two regimes are distinguishable: one with high predictability and the other with low predictability, showing a deep analogy with the heterogeneous dynamics of the World countries. Furthermore, we compare the ranking of the Brazilian states according to the Exogenous Fitness with the ranking obtained through two other techniques, namely Endogenous Fitness and Economic Complexity Index.},

Identifying patterns of economic resilience in regions by industry categories is the focus of this paper. Patterns emerge from adaptive capacity in four distinct functional groups of local government regions in Australia, in respect of their resilience from shocks on specific industries. A model of regional adaptive cycles around four sequential phases â reorganization, exploitation, conservation and release â is adopted as the framework for recognizing such patterns. A data-mining method utilizes a k-means algorithm to evaluate the impact of two major shocks â a 13-year drought and the Global Financial Crisis â on four functional groups of regions, using census data from 2001, 2006 and 2011.},

@article{Oreiro2020,
abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the determinants of the deindustrialization of the Brazilian economy in the period 1998-2017. We shall argue that the Brazilian case is a typical example of Premature Deindustrialization in the sense that a large share of the fall in the manufacturing share is not due to the increase in the per-capita income over some threshold value, as the case of advanced economies in the 1970Â´s; but the consequence of real exchange rate overvaluation occurred in Brazil since the beginning of the 2000Â´s. In the Brazilian case, however, real exchange rate overvaluation results both from an appreciation of real effective exchange rate, as well as an increase in the equilibrium value of real exchange rate, the so-called industrial equilibrium exchange rate of the New-Developmentalism literature. The rise of the equilibrium level of real exchange rate is due, mainly, to the huge reduction of the economic complexity of the Brazilian economy. For doing that we will present a new methodology for calculation of industrial equilibrium exchange rate, since the existing methodology, developed by Marconi (2012), had some important limitations. The policy implication of our results is that the elimination of real exchange rate overvaluation in Brazil requires not only the adoption of a macroeconomic policy regime in which some kind of real exchange rate targeting is adopted; but also industrial policies designed for increase the economic complexity of Brazilian economy and, hence, to reduce the equilibrium value of real exchange rate, making the required adjustment in real exchange rate socially and politically viable.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between bank diversity and small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) firm innovation in China to evaluate the impact of recent bank deregulation. Design/methodology/approach: Using a large data set that includes 8,143 firm-year observations of 1,122 listed SME firms in China and baseline and robustness regression analyses, the authors identify how bank diversity affects firm innovation and via what economic mechanisms. Potential endogeneity problems are considered and addressed in the design and analysis to minimize research bias. Findings: The authors find robust evidence that bank diversity improves firm innovation. Specifically, the findings suggest that the positive effects of bank diversity on firm innovation are only significant for the firms which are more external finance dependent, have fewer growth opportunities and/or located in the provinces having low financial market development. Originality/value: This study provides novel evidence and insights into the relationship between banking market structure and the determinants of firm innovation in the Chinese context, as a result of China's banking deregulation.},

@article{Palley2011,
abstract = {This paper argues that Hyman Minsky's financial instability hypothesis weaves together the medium-term Keynesian dynamic embodied in the Samuelson (1939)-Hicks (1950) approach to the business cycle with the long cycle thinking of economists such as Schumpeter (1939) and Kondratieff. Post Keynesians have devoted considerable attention to the medium-term dimension of Minsky's thinking. The current paper concentrates on the long-swing dimension and introduces the idea of 'Minsky super-cycles'. It is the super-cycle that ultimately permits financial crisis. Whereas financially driven business cycles occur every decade, financial crises occur over longer durations reflecting the longer phase of the super-cycle. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

In these circumstances, it is argued, specific financial set-ups - such as 'market-based' vs. 'credit-based' mechanisms of allocation, control and ownership transfer - are likely to exert different influences on the rates and modes of industrial innovation. Relatedly, one suggests some hypotheses on the links between financial systems and features of industrial evolution, and some tentative taxonomies. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

The 17-year panel data regression analysis on 35 OECD countries and Russia provides evidence to potential causal relationships between value-added of industry and several investment variables. As a proxy variable for research and development performance, value-added of industry indicates a statistically significant positive relationship with business-performed expenditure of government-funding on R&D. It indicates negative relationships with government-performed expenditure of government-funding on R&D and regulatory burdens. The results suggest that national R&D policy should guarantee less regulatory burden and more autonomy of government-funded R&D projects.},

There are opportunities to further the science of wastewater-based epidemiology by monitoring viral RNA in wastewater to assess disease prevalence and spread in defined populations, which may prove beneficial for informing COVID-19 related public health policy.},

@article{Castro2020,
abstract = {COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

abstract = {Banks and regional development: an empirical analysis on the determinants of credit availability in Brazilian regions, Regional Studies. This paper studies the influence that liquidity preference and bank lending strategies might have played in the determination of bank credit availability in Brazilian regions during the period 1999â2008. It puts forward the argument that in remoter and less developed regions, the liquidity pre- ference of agents is higher and fluctuates along business cycles, reducing regional credit availability in downturns (due to both a contraction in supply and the demand for credit in remoter regions), and producing a more unstable pattern for credit availability alongside business cycles. Empirical evidence for the Brazilian regions during the period 1999â2008 is provided to support this},

@article{Niedzwiedz2020,
abstract = {Background Understanding of the role of ethnicity and socioeconomic position in the risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. Methods The UK Biobank study recruited 40-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including Townsend deprivation index and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for: being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 1,474 had been tested and 669 had tested positive between 16 March and 13 April 2020. Black, south Asian and white Irish people were more likely to have confirmed infection (RR 4.01 (95%CI 2.92-5.12); RR 2.11 (95%CI 1.43-3.10); and RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.08-2.38) respectively) and were more likely to be hospitalised compared to White British. While they were more likely to be tested, they were also more likely to test positive. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Area socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 1.91 (95%CI 1.53-2.38); and RR 2.26 (95%CI 1.76-2.90) respectively). Interpretation Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, measured baseline health or behavioural risk factors. An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required. Funding Medical Research Council, Chief Scientist Office.

abstract = {The present study examines state-level banking-industry specific as well as region economic determinants of non-performing loans for all commercial banks and savings institutions across 50 US states and the District of Columbia for 1984-2013. Using both fixed effects and dynamic-GMM estimations, I find greater capitalization, liquidity risks, poor credit quality, greater cost inefficiency and banking industry size to significantly increase NPLs, while greater bank profitability lowers NPLs. Moreover, higher state real GDP and real personal income growth rates, and changes in state housing price index reduce NPLs, while inflation, state unemployment rates, and US public debt significantly increase NPLs. The findings imply that regular stress tests on banks' loan quality that typically underpin scenarios for a rise in NPLs, should take into account the impact of 'micro' or state-level economic conditions on NPLs, in addition to banks' capital and credit quality, and effective cost management in assessing banks financial health.},

abstract = {Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is widely associated with disease and mortality, and there is no reason to think this will not be the case for the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has reached a pandemic level. Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19. SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general. We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning. However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation. Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19. From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease. This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations. A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.},

abstract = {A country's mix of products predicts its subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex productsâas measured by the Economic Complexity Indexâhave lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related productsâor product spaceâto illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality. Finally, we make our results available through an online resource that allows for its users to visualize the structural transformation of over 150 countries and their associated changes in income inequality during 1963â2008.},

For this purpose, we have developed an analytical approach based on the contributions of John M.

abstract = {In this paper we empirically analyze Minskian dynamics in the US economy by applying Minsky's classifications of financing regimes to a firm-level panel of nonfinancial corporations. We first map Minsky's definitions of hedge, speculative and Ponzi finance into firm-level data, and describe the incidence and evolution of Minksian regimes across nonfinancial corporations since the early 1970s. Second, we explore the relationship between fluctuations in the aggregate economy and firms' likelihood of being in a fragile finance regime, and find evidence of small short-run Minsky cycles. To do so, we use linear probability models relating a firm's probability of being Ponzi to aggregate and sectoral output gaps, and find that these output gaps â which capture variations in macroeconomic conditions exogenous to individual firms â are correlated with an increased probability that a firm is Ponzi. These results are corroborated by quantile regressions based on a continuous financial fragility measure â the interest coverage ratio â that identify differential effects of business cycles on financial fragility at different quantiles of the interest coverage distribution.},

abstract = {A difus{\~{a}}o de cadeias globais de valor (CGVs) gerou uma enorme literatura sobre o tema, em geral focada na dimens{\~{a}}o empresarial ou setorial do fen{\^{o}}meno. Gradu-almente, o debate deslocou-se para a esfera da economia como um todo e ganhou uma dimens{\~{a}}o normativa, concretizada pela ideia de que existem pol{\'{i}}ticas que favorecem ou desfavorecem a conex{\~{a}}o das economias nacionais {\`{a}}s cadeias de valor e que tal conex{\~{a}}o tem o potencial para gerar mais benef{\'{i}}cios do que custos para as economias que adotam pol{\'{i}}ticas pr{\'{o}}-cadeias. Esse argumento normativo parece mais consistente quando aplicado a eco-nomias pequenas e a pa{\'{i}}ses pouco desenvolvidos, aparecendo a conex{\~{a}}o {\`{a}}s cadeias como uma esp{\'{e}}cie de via r{\'{a}}pida para uma industrializa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o menos exigente em integra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o vertical. Mas sua aplica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} mais dif{\'{i}}cil no caso de economias que j{\'{a}} estabeleceram uma base industrial relativamente diversificada-com algum grau de integra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o vertical.

The theoretical part hypothesizes that fluctuations in aggregate income and price level adversely affect the well-being of the business sector and links the likelihood of firm failure to structural parameters governing the business cycles. Our empirical findings for the United States indicate that the annual rate of bankruptcy is positively correlated with the variances of the GNP and the GNP deflator and negatively correlated with the covariance of these variables. ?? 1987.},

@article{Kisely2020,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the psychological effects on clinicians of working to manage novel viral outbreaks, and successful measures to manage stress and psychological distress. DESIGN Rapid review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. RESULTS 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Effective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak. These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.},

The identification was obtained based on the institutional information of both budget and tributary systems, and through the analysis of the operational procedure of the fiscal authorities. The results obtained are close to the account of the empiric literature for the American economy and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country members: the response of the product to the fiscal shocks is small and has characteristic typically Keynesian.},

abstract = {How CEOs with different characteristics act differently on R & D investment under the condition of financial constraints is an important but understudied question towards firms' sustainable innovation. Employing the dataset from China-Enterprise Survey 2012 of the World Bank, this study tests the impact of financial constraints on firms' R & D investment and the moderating role of CEO characteristics. Empirical results show that: (1) firm's financial constraints have a significant restricting effect on their R & D investment; (2) internal financial constraints have no significant restricting effect on R & D investment for firms with female CEOs in comparison with firms with male CEOs, while the external financial constraints have a significant restricting effect on R & D investment for both groups. (3) CEO experience has a non-linear moderating effect on the relationship between financial constraints and a firm's R & D investment. When the accumulated experience is overloaded, the positive moderating effect of CEO experience begins to decline and even become negative. Robustness tests further confirm these empirical findings. This study directly contributes to the literature of financing innovation and top management team's impact on firms' sustainable innovation, and generates insights on firms' R & D management under the condition of financial constraints.},

We argue that aggregate business failures should not be treated as a passive variable, as usually done in previous studies, and we allow its possible causal effect on other macroeconomic variables through a Structural Vector Autoregression model that builds on Directed Acyclic Graphs. Granger type causality and innovation accounting results both show that while subject to the influence of interest rates, aggregate business failures are quite exogenous in comparison to the other three variables.

abstract = {This paper describes the pattern of reductions in mortality across Brazilian municipalities between 1970 and 2000, and analyzes its causes and consequences. It shows that, as in the international context, the relationship between income and life expectancy has shifted consistently in the recent past. But reductions in mortality within Brazil have been more homogeneously distributed than across countries. We use a compensating differentials approach to estimate the value of the observed reductions in mortality. The results suggest that gains in life expectancy had a welfare value equivalent to 39% of the growth in income per capita, being therefore responsible for 28% of the overall improvement in welfare. We then use a dynamic panel to conduct a preliminary assessment of the potential determinants of these gains. We show that improvements in education, access to water, and sanitation seem to be important determinants of the dimension of changes in life expectancy not correlated with income. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In rural areas, many municipalities still do not have bank branches and credit cooperatives emerge as alternative institutions in providing credit, with distinct characteristics of banks, given their importance for local development. This study seeks to measure the impact of the implementation of supportive rural credit cooperatives in Brazilian municipalities on per capita GDP of agriculture (value added) using two quasi-experimental methods to provide robustness to the findings on the impact. It was verified a positive causal relationship, using differences-in-differences with matching by propensity score, indicating an average impact of the presence of supportive rural credit cooperatives on per capita agricultural GDP in 2010 of R$ 987,66, significant at 5%. Positive coefficients for the treatment variable were also observed in OLS regressions weighted by propensity scores, with the per capita GDP of agriculture roughly 20% higher for municipalities that created supportive rural credit cooperatives between 2008 and 2009. These results show the importance of creating supportive rural credit cooperatives in rural areas of Brazilian municipalities, especially in those that do not have them yet, since the role of these cooperatives is being played in order to contribute to the local growth.},

abstract = {In the present day, innovation has become a key element of competitive advantage. However, most countries are failing in their innovative activities, and their innovative performance is below that of the EU average. Therefore, the European Commission annually publishes its Innovation Union Scoreboard, which provides a comparative assessment of the EU member states' research and innovation performance. The countries are divided into four groups according to their innovation performance: innovation leaders, strong innovators, moderate innovators, and modest innovators. In this paper, we have selected countries whose innovation performance was close to, below, or well below that of the EU average in 2015 and we have performed microeconomic analysis of the situation in these countries' firms to analyse the conditions of their innovation environment and uncover barriers to their innovation activities. We analysed firms in the manufacturing industries in Slovenia (a strong innovator), Croatia (a moderate innovator), and Romania (a modest innovator) by using original multiple regression models and data from the 2010-2012 Community Innovation Survey. The results demonstrate the different backgrounds for innovation in each country. In Romania, there is a lack of both a satisfactory environment for innovation and sufficient capacity for absorbing public funds; investment into innovation-related activities is also absent. In Croatia, the innovation potential has not been fully exploited. However, we show that the appropriate targeting of innovation determinants (e.g., collaboration with different partners or public financing) could lead to the creation of synergies and spillover effects that would be able to support their innovative activities and strengthen the country's competitiveness. There is a completely different situation in Slovenia. Firms there effectively utilize the various determinants of innovation activities, and these determinants have strong influence when utilized on their own. On the other hand, results also show that certain significant combinations of determinants of innovation activities are missing in Slovenia. In conclusion, we have proposed practical implications for policy makers that would be able to support innovative activities and help each country to improve its innovation ranking.},

abstract = {Network technologies have facilitated the implementation of health services based on ubiquitous systems, allowing pervasive monitoring of patients in their daily activities without significantly interfering in their lifestyle. This event entails the need to ensure adequate management and security of healthcare environment networks. However, traffic monitoring became an arduous work, requiring autonomic mechanisms to describe the network's normal behavior. Thus, Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow analysis(DSNSF) as a mechanism to assist the networks management through traffic characterization is introduced. For this purpose, three methods belonging to different groups of algorithms are used: the statistical procedure Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic and Holt'Winters forecasting method. These methods characterize the traffic into two distinct levels. The first one is the network infrastructure, which encompasses the entire network, including non-healthcare data from different sectors which compose an e-health environment. Profile creation about traffic used for monitoring of patients' vital and behavioral signs identifies the second level. Also, an approach for anomaly detection is proposed, which is able to recognize unusual events that may affect the proper operation of the services provided by the network.},

In order to do that, we introduce some modifications in the basic structure of that model, that is : (i) investment finance made by equities and bank credit ; (ii) low sensibility of demand for equities in relation to interest rates. These new hypothesis are sufficient to produce a backward bending equilibrium locus in financial markets and to assure that the effect of an increase in the state of confidence over equilibrium levels of interest rate and capacity utilization is conditional to the initial level of the state of confidence. In this setting, can be shown the existence of a U-shaped relation between state of confidence and financial fragility. This relation is sufficient to produce (i) two steady-state positions for the state of confidence and (ii) an endogenous cycle for the state of confidence and capacity utilization.},

We find that firms operating in municipalities with less congested courts experienced larger increase in the use of secured loans, as well as a larger increase in investment and value of output in the years after the reform. To establish the direction of causality, we use an instrumental variable strategy that exploits Brazilian state laws on judicial organization, and focus on differences in court congestion across otherwise similar neighboring municipalities located across judicial district borders within the same state. Together, the evidence indicates that differences in court enforcement affect the impact of financial reform on firm access to finance, investment and size.},

abstract = {During the first 90 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, over 675,000 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported, posing unprecedented socioeconomic burden to the country. Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.},

abstract = {Developmental psychology has been a subarea of interest for Behavior Analysis. Considering that B. F. Skinner set up the basis of behavioral analysis, there are questions about the author's position with respect to issues from developmental psychology. However, Skinner has not written a text in which he compiled his overview about this subject matter. His conception of human development is distributed in different publications. Then, this paper aims to give an overview about the contributions for studying human development based on Skinner's published books between the decades of 1930 and 1980. Therefore, in this bibliographic research, passages from twenty Skinner's books, which are related to the development, were examined. This examination indicates that Skinner has studied different concepts used in developmental psychology, prioritizing the discussion about some of them in some decades. Then, each decade is marked by a set of contributions for understanding human development. Skinner has understood the concept of development mainly as a metaphor. As such, this metaphor is committed to the idea of internal behavioral determinants. The allocation of internal causes for behavioral changes contradicts the fundamental hypothesis of the Radical Behaviorism: that the study of behavior on its own right is sufficient to explain psychological processes. Because of this, Skinner has warned that the use of developmental metaphor in behavioral science should be cautious. The clarification of Skinner's contributions regarding the development may open up new possibilities for dialogue between developmental psychology and Behavior Analysis.

@inproceedings{Linardi2008,
abstract = {This dissertation investigates the relationship between the delinquency rate on Brazilian banks' loans and macroeconomic factors for the period 2000 to 2007 using a VAR (Vector Autoregression) model. Loans were divided into State-owned and private financial institutions in order to assess the effect of macroeconomic shocks on the delinquency rate of these institutions. The results show that the delinquency rate of financial institutions is particularly sensitive to shocks on output gap, variation of the index of average income of workers and nominal interest rate. The estimated model produced good out of sample\r\nforecasts of delinquency rate and the results indicate that they are not worse than the forecasts of two competing models. The VAR model also allowed us to estimate the correlations of macro variables and to compute the probability that the delinquency rate exceeds a given threshold deemed risky through Monte Carlo simulations. This procedure may be used as an additional tool of credit risk management by the Central Bank and financial institutions.},

abstract = {Motivation: Small and medium-sized enterprises, due to their large number, play an important role in the development of the Polish economy. Therefore, the focus should be on creating the right frameworks for their functioning - they should allow them to develop and stimulate the implementation of innovative solutions. Business support organizations (BSOs) are one of the entities that can facilitate development ant stimulation. The main types of BSOs in Poland are: technological parks and incubators, academic business incubators, centers for technology transfer, business angels networks, local/regional load funds, credit guarantee funds, and training and consulting centers. These entities should contribute to the implementation of new solutions in the surveyed enterprises and improve their competitive position. Aim: The aim of the article is to identify impact of business support organization on the innovation activity in industrial enterprises in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The research hypothesis is the claim that BSOs increase the odds of implementation of new products and process in enterprises, but their impact will be different. The hypothesis will be validated on a sample of 442 small and medium-sized, manufacturing companies, which are located in Greater Poland Voivodeship. To carry out the study a multi-factor logit regression method will be used. Results: The research hypothesis is confirmed - BSOs increase the chances on innovation activity but their influence is different. Most effective are training and consulting centers and financing organizations, but this institution stimulate the implementation of new products and processes on the scale of the enterprise and innovation centers (technology parks, academic business incubators and technology transfer offices) of the country.},

abstract = {Editorial Reviews Peter Lindner, Vice-President, Lehman Brothers Inc. "This book is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in empirical macroeconomics or in advanced techniques of time series analysis. It clearly shows how the adoption of new econometric techniques leads to new and better answers to existing questions, as well as to new questions, too." Salih N. Nefti, Graduate School, City University of New York "This is a comprehensive and scholarly treatment of the business cycle phenomena. It will serve as an excellent guide to researchers as well as practitioners." Book Description This is the most sophisticated and up-to-date econometric analysis of business cycles now available. Francis Diebold and Glenn Rudebusch have long been acknowledged as leading experts on business cycles. And here they present a highly integrative collection of their most important essays on the subject, along with a detailed introduction that draws together the book's principal themes and findings. Diebold and Rudebusch use the latest quantitative methods to address five principal questions Diebold and Rudebusch use the latest quantitative methods to address five principal questions about the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of business cycles. They ask whether business cycles have become more moderate in the postwar period, concluding that recessions have, in fact, been shorter and shallower. They consider whether economic expansions and contractions tend to die of "old age." Contrary to popular wisdom, they find little evidence that expansions become more fragile the longer they last, although they do find that contractions are increasingly likely to end as they age. The authors discuss the defining characteristics of business cycles, focusing on how economic variables move together and on the timing of the slow alternation between expansions and contractions. They explore the difficulties of distinguishing between long-term trends in the economy and cyclical fluctuations. And they examine how business cycles can be forecast, looking in particular at how to predict turning points in cycles, rather than merely the level of future economic activity. They show here that the index of leading economic indicators is a poor predictor of future economic activity, and consider what we can learn from other indicators, such as financial variables. Throughout, the authors make use of a variety of advanced econometric techniques, including nonparametric analysis, fractional integration, and regime-switching models. Business Cycles is crucial reading for policymakers, bankers, and business executives About the Author Francis X. Diebold is Professor of Economics and of Statistics at the University of Pennsylvania and Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

abstract = {Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health threat. Early and quick identification of the potential risk zones of COVID-19 infection is increasingly vital for the megacities implementing targeted infection prevention and control measures. In this study, the communities with confirmed cases during January 21âFebruary 27 were collected and considered as the specific epidemic data for Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We evaluated the spatiotemporal variations of the epidemics before utilizing the ecological niche models (ENM) to assemble the epidemic data and nine socioeconomic variables for identifying the potential risk zones of this infection in these megacities. Three megacities were differentiated by the spatial patterns and quantities of infected communities, average cases per community, the percentages of imported cases, as well as the potential risks, although their COVID-19 infection situations have been preliminarily contained to date. With higher risks that were predominated by various influencing factors in each megacity, the potential risk zones coverd about 75% to 100% of currently infected communities. Our results demonstrate that the ENM method was capable of being employed as an early forecasting tool for identifying the potential COVID-19 infection risk zones on a fine scale. We suggest that local hygienic authorities should keep their eyes on the epidemic in each megacity for sufficiently implementing and adjusting their interventions in the zones with more residents or probably crowded places. This study would provide useful clues for relevant hygienic departments making quick responses to increasingly severe epidemics in similar megacities in the world.},

abstract = {Purpose - Although big data have emerged at the cornerstone of business and management research, past studies have failed to offer explanations and classifications of different levels of capacity and expertise possessed by different countries in utilising big data. The purpose of this paper is to examine the different capacities of governments in utilising big data. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a comprehensive synopsis of the literature on big data and the role of governments in utilising and harnessing big data. Findings - The study provides an array of explanations to account for why some countries are adept at using big data to solve social problems, while others often faltered. Research limitations/implications - The study offers a range of explanations and suggestions, which include skills upgrading, to help countries improve their capabilities in data collection and data analysis. Originality/value - In this paper, data collection-data analysis matrix was developed to characterise the role of governments in data collection and analysis.},

abstract = {The high costs of crises underscore the need to strengthen the resilience of economies, notably by assessing early on potential vulnerabilities that can lead to such costly events. This paper first discusses the source and nature of potential vulnerabilities in OECD countries that can lead to costly economic crises. Based on the most recent evidence from the early warning literature and lessons learned from the global financial crisis, it then proposes a new dataset of more than 70 vulnerability indicators that could be monitored to assess country risks in OECD economies. The indicators are grouped into five domestic areas: i) financial sector imbalances, ii) non-financial sector imbalances, iii) asset market imbalances, iv) public sector imbalances and v) external sector imbalances. An additional international âspillovers, contagion and global risksâ category aims at capturing vulnerabilities that could transmit from one country to another through financial, trade or confidence channels. Evidence in a companion paper (Hermansen and R{\"{o}}hn, 2015) shows that the majority of the proposed indicators for which sufficiently long time series exists is helpful in predicting severe recessions and crises in the 34 OECD economies and Latvia between 1970 and 2014.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to construct a model of the demand for the commodity "good health." The central proposition of the model is that health can be viewed as a durable capital stock that produces an output of healthy time. It is assumed that individuals inherit an initial stock of health that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. In this framework, the "shadow price" of health depends on many other variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education if more educated people are more efficient producers of health. Of particular importance is the conclusion that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantity of medical care demanded.},

Highlights More than 3.5 million cases of COVID-19 and 250,000 deaths have now been reported to WHO. At yesterday's media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, referring to the fact that crises can exacerbate existing inequalities, reiterated that 'We cannot end the pandemic until we address the inequalities that are fueling it.' He also highlighted six criteria that WHO recommends countries should take into account when considering the easing of lockdown restrictions. WHO, UNICEF and the International Federation of the Red Cross have published guidance for countries on how to maintain community-based healthcare in the context of COVID-19. it complements the United Nations framework for the socioeconomic response to COVID-19. WHO and the Delegation of the European Union (EU) have announced a new collaboration in Somalia to strengthen operational response activities for COVID-19. COVID-19 messages are reaching new audiences in Turkey as Goodwill Ambassadors from United Nations agencies in the country share information from WHO with their followers.

abstract = {According to the existing literature, accounting information represents an important predictor of a company's future cash flow and serves to assess the risk of stock investments. Because such information reflects the economic and financial reality of a company during a given period, this information relates to the systematic risk of an investment, which justifies the use of the information for decisions related to the composition of a stock portfolio. Within this context, the present study seeks to present empirical evidence on the relationship between accounting information and systematic risk in the Brazilian market. More specifically, the objective is to analyze the relationship between the accounting betas and the market betas of companies in Brazil. For this analysis, 97 companies from 15 economic sectors were selected from the Securities, Commodities, and Futures Exchange of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros de S{\~{a}}o Paulo â BM&FBOVESPA) from the first quarter of 1995 to the third quarter of 2009. A total of 468 accounting variables were used. To operationalize the relationship between the variables, a regression model with panel data was used. One the one hand, the results show that some accounting betas may explain the market beta and do so in an anticipated manner and that these accounting betas are able to improve the prediction of the market beta when used alongside the historical market betas. On the other hand, the majority of accounting beta versions displayed a rather insignificant or even nonexistent relationship.},

The analysis is performed by representing the linkages between microeconomic financial variables and the aggregate performance of the economy by means of a microfounded model with firms that have heterogeneous capital structures. The model is solved both numerically and analytically, by means of a stochastic approximation that is able to replicate quite well the numerical solution. These methodologies, by overcoming the restrictions imposed by the traditional microfounded approach, enable us to provide some insights into the stabilization policies which may be effective in a financially fragile system. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: It is an ecological study considering TB as the basic cause for deaths registered between 2006 and 2013 on the Mortality Information System and other variables obtained through the Demographic Census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (2010). The geographical area for analysis comprised the areas of coverage of the health services. Social indicators have been constructed through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The cases were geocoded and the annual mortality rate from TB was calculated with smoothing using the local empirical Bayesian method. Multiple linear regression was then performed. There was confirmation of the existence of spatial dependence of residue through the application of the Global Moran I test, and application of the Models with Global Spatial Effects, to identify the best standard of spatial regression. Results: The mortality rates ranged from 0.00 to 2.8 deaths per 100,000 people, per year. In the PCA, three indicators were constructed, and designated as indicators of income, social inequality, and social equity. In multiple linear regression, the indicator of social equity was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) but had a negative association, an adjusted R2 of 28.36% and with spatial dependence (Moran I = 0.21, P = 0.003455). The best model to deal with existing spatial dependence was the Spatial Lag Model. Conclusions: The better social conditions have shown progress in reducing mortality from TB, thereby reinforcing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, cartography was also applied, which can be replicated in other scenarios throughout the world, using a scope distinct from that of works traditionally produced in that it places the emphasis on social equity.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The list of topics covered is large: meteorology and air quality factors with correlation number of infections, sewage waters as a way to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, current hospital disinfection procedures and new eco-friendly technologies and list of drug therapies recommend waiting for the desired vaccine to come. During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem. The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19. That being said I believe that this Opinion Paper can serve as multipurpose document, not only for scientists of different disciplines but for social media and citizens in general.},

abstract = {This paper examines three channels of influence of the business cycle in the propensity of firms to introduce technological innovations: Aggregate demand (firms initiate more innovation projects in expansion than in recession; risk (the probability that initiated projects fail is higher in contraction than in expansion); and obstacles to innovate (more firms perceive the obstacles to innovate as high in recessions than in expansions and the high obstacles implies lower propensity to initiate innovation projects). With Spanish CIS data we find evidence that the three channels contributed to the fall in the proportion of firms that introduce technological innovations during the Great Recession, compared with the proportion of innovators in the years of expansion. The research methodology consists on estimating a multiprobit model with the probability that firms introduce technological innovations, the probability that firms abandon ongoing innovation projects, and the probability that firms perceive the obstacles to innovate as high.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A new economic geography of finance is emerging, and the current "financialization" of contemporary economies has contributed greatly to the reshaping of the economic landscape. How can these changes be understood and interpreted, especially from a territorial point of view? There are two contradictory economic theories regarding the tangible effects of the rise of the finance industry. According to neoclassical financial theorists, the finance industry's success is based on its positive effects on the real economy through its capacity to allocate financial resources efficiently. An alternative approach, adopted here, posits that finance does not merely mirror the real economy and that the financial economy, far from being a simple instrument for the allocation of capital, has its own autonomy, its own logic of development and expansion. A series of complex, and sometimes contradictory, connections link financial markets and the real economy, and there are some tensions between them, calling into question the coherence of the regional and national economies that follow from them. Moreover, the territorial approach shows how the mobility/liquidity of capital and the changing dimensions of new regions and countries are central to the finance industry's functioning. This article builds an understanding of the financial system through the lens of pension funds and highlights the impact of such a system on the real economy and its geography.},

abstract = {Introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o: antecedentes da grande recess{\~{a}}o grande recess{\~{a}}o iniciada no segundo trimestre de 2014 {\'{e}} a mais profun-da e duradoura queda do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade econ{\^{o}}mica desde o t{\'{e}}rmino da Segunda Guerra Mundial. 1 Com efeito, entre o segundo trimestre de 2014 e o terceiro trimestre de 2016, o PIB brasileiro apresentou uma queda de 8,33% de acordo com os dados do Ipeadata. No momento em que escrevo este artigo, os dados do PIB do quarto trimestre ainda n{\~{a}}o foram divulgados, mas as estimativas existentes com base no {\'{i}}ndice de atividade econ{\^{o}}mica do Banco Central do Brasil apontam para a continuidade do movimento de queda do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade econ{\^{o}}mica no {\'{u}}ltimo trimestre do ano passado, com uma queda de 0,36% com rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o ao trimestre imediatamente anterior (Valor Econ{\^{o}}mico, 2017a). Na Figura 1 podemos visualizar o comportamento do PIB real no Brasil no per{\'{i}}odo compreendido entre o primeiro trimestre de 2003 e o terceiro tri-mestre de 2016. Aplicando uma linha de tend{\^{e}}ncia linear aos dados, observa-se que a economia brasileira apresentou uma tend{\^{e}}ncia de crescimento de 0,94% por trimestre, o que equivale a uma taxa anualizada de crescimento de 3,78%. A inspe{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da Figura 1 nos permite tamb{\'{e}}m constatar que entre 2003 e 2006 a economia brasileira operava ligeiramente abaixo de sua tend{\^{e}}ncia de longo prazo. A partir de 2007, contudo, essa situa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o se inverte e a economia brasileira passa a operar acima de sua tend{\^{e}}ncia, exceto por um breve per{\'{i}}odo entre o final de 2008 e o in{\'{i}}cio de 2009, o qual compreende os efeitos da crise financeira internacional. Essa invers{\~{a}}o no sinal do hiato do produto decorre da flexibiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do trip{\'{e}} macroecon{\^{o}}mico ap{\'{o}}s 2006, com a elimina{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da siste-m{\'{a}}tica de metas declinantes de infla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da meta de super{\'{a}}vit prim{\'{a}}rio e ado{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de uma regra de valoriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do sal{\'{a}}rio m{\'{i}}nimo (Oreiro, 2016, cap.8). A flexibiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do trip{\'{e}} macroecon{\^{o}}mico viabilizou uma not{\'{a}}vel acelera-{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do crescimento da economia brasileira em 2010. Conforme podemos veri-ficar na Figura 2, o crescimento do PIB nos dois primeiros trimestres de 2010, na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com o mesmo per{\'{i}}odo do ano anterior, supera a marca de 8%. A partir de 2011, contudo, observa-se uma desacelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do ritmo de crescimento da economia brasileira. Com efeito, no {\'{u}}ltimo trimestre de 2014 A grande recess{\~{a}}o brasileira: diagn{\'{o}}stico e uma agenda de pol{\'{i}}tica econ{\^{o}}mica JOS{\'{E}} LUIS OREIRO I A 10.1590/s0103-40142017.31890009 ESTUDOS AVAN{\c{C}}ADOS 31 (89), 2017 76 o crescimento do PIB real havia se reduzido para 2,63% na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com o {\'{u}}ltimo trimestre de 2010. A desacelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do crescimento continua at{\'{e}} o se-gundo trimestre de 2012, quando o PIB apresentou uma expans{\~{a}}o de 1,05% na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com o segundo trimestre do ano anterior. A assim chamada " nova matriz macroecon{\^{o}}mica " foi uma tentativa do governo da presidente Dilma Rousseff de impulsionar o crescimento econ{\^{o}}mi-co atrav{\'{e}}s de uma combina{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de desonera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es tribut{\'{a}}rias, deprecia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da taxa nominal de c{\^{a}}mbio e redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da taxa b{\'{a}}sica de juros. A equipe econ{\^{o}}mica do governo partia do diagn{\'{o}}stico de que a desacelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do crescimento econ{\^{o}}mi-co brasileiro era um problema de demanda agregada que tinha sua origem no recrudescimento da crise econ{\^{o}}mica internacional, em fun{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos problemas de endividamento soberano dos pa{\'{i}}ses da {\'{a}}rea do euro. A " nova matriz " conseguiu produzir uma acelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tempor{\'{a}}ria do ritmo de crescimento econ{\^{o}}mico. No per{\'{i}}odo compreendido entre o terceiro trimes-tre de 2012 ao primeiro trimestre de 2014, a economia brasileira consegue sus-tentar um ritmo anualizado de crescimento superior a 2,5%. A partir do segundo trimestre de 2014 o ritmo de crescimento entra em co-lapso. No segundo trimestre desse ano, o PIB apresenta uma queda de 0,33% na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com o mesmo per{\'{i}}odo de 2013. O ritmo de decrescimento se acelera no terceiro trimestre para 0,58% na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com o 2013/T3. Ap{\'{o}}s uma ligei-ra redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do ritmo de decrescimento no final de 2014, o ritmo de queda do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade econ{\^{o}}mica se acelera no primeiro trimestre de 2015, quando o PIB real apresenta uma contra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de 1,87% na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com o primeiro trimestre de 2014. Na compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre o primeiro trimestre de 2014 e o primeiro trimes-tre de 2015 ocorre uma redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de 5,18 p.p. na taxa de crescimento do PIB. Nos trimestres subsequentes o ritmo de queda do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade se aprofunda, fazendo que o PIB se contraia a um ritmo de 5,82% no {\'{u}}ltimo tri-mestre de 2015. O movimento de queda do PIB continua ao longo do ano de 2016, mas a um ritmo decrescente, sugerindo que a economia brasileira se encontra numa trajet{\'{o}}ria de estabiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade, o qual provavel-mente deve ser obtido no primeiro trimestre de 2017. Caso essa expectativa se confirme, o Brasil ter{\'{a}} experimentado 11 trimestres consecutivos de queda do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade econ{\^{o}}mica. O padr{\~{a}}o de comportamento exibido pela economia brasileira desde o segundo trimestre de 2014 nos coloca duas quest{\~{o}}es para reflex{\~{a}}o. A primeira quest{\~{a}}o refere-se ao porqu{\^{e}} o ritmo de crescimento entrou em colapso a partir do segundo trimestre de 2014, ao inv{\'{e}}s de apresentar uma desacelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o mais gradual ao longo do ano? A segunda quest{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} por quais motivos o ritmo de queda do n{\'{i}}vel de atividade se intensifica a partir do primeiro trimestre de 2015? A resposta a essas duas quest{\~{o}}es {\'{e}} de fundamental import{\^{a}}ncia para po-dermos desenhar uma agenda de proposi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de pol{\'{i}}tica econ{\^{o}}mica com vistas a retomada do crescimento.},

We build on a new approach to innovation policy, which we call market co-creating and shaping, in which the state is not only fixing markets but actively co-creating them. We also look at the legal institutions that determine (and are determined by) the relationship between public and private actors. Policy measures to institutionalize rewards in a way that promote more equitable publicâprivate partnerships can be understood as attempts to mediate asymmetric power relations, tensions and conflicting views among multiple stakeholders, as well as building a shared notion of the value and legitimacy of the role of the state. We conclude by outlining analytical and policy implications and identifying avenues for future research.},

abstract = {This study uses panel data to investigate the impact of programs funded by Chilean economic development agency (CORFO). The data correspond to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd waves of the Longitudinal Survey of Firms. This study demonstrates that the impact of INNOVA program on firm's probability of generating innovation in products and/or services disappears when innovative characteristics are controled. Moreover, as these variables are observables in the selection process is possible that CORFO could be 'picking winners' that had developed these innovations independently of public funding. Furthermore, it is found that FOGAPE program changes the firms' funding sources.},

O advento da internet e for{\c{c}}as pol{\'{i}}ticas de interesse da globaliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o conectaram de forma impressionante todos os locais do mundo, inclusive na ci{\^{e}}ncia, num processo crescente que n{\~{a}}o ter{\'{a}} fim t{\~{a}}o cedo. Essa conectividade mudou drasticamente a vida do ser humano. De todas as transforma{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es humanas, talvez esta tenha sido a mais marcante, principalmente pela alta velocidade que imp{\~{o}}e em rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\`{a}}s mudan{\c{c}}as precedentes. Nesse ambiente, a comunica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o cient{\'{i}}fica foi grandemente afetada, sendo a resposta dos cientistas uma mistura de acertos e desacertos. Com a maior visibilidade das atividades cient{\'{i}}ficas, incluindo aqueles que jamais seriam vistos no meio tradicional dessa comunica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, o sistema cient{\'{i}}fico de pro-du{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de conhecimento exacerbou sua a{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o como empreendimento tanto epistemol{\'{o}}gico quanto co-mercial, um panorama no qual o pensamento capitalista marcou definitivamente. Apesar disso tudo, minha leitura {\'{e}} que, nos {\'{u}}ltimos 20 anos dessas grandes transforma{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es, a ci{\^{e}}ncia caminhou muito mais em dire{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\`{a}}s suas bases do que se distanciando delas. Aqui discorro sobre um aspecto desse amplo panorama: a internacionaliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da publica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Nos {\'{u}}ltimos anos da d{\'{e}}cada de 1990, surge a iniciativa Scielo, cuja principal contribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o foi dar visibilidade {\`{a}}s revistas cient{\'{i}}ficas brasileiras. A principal visibilidade, no entanto, foi obtida quando a revista entrou na base Web of Science. Na entrada do s{\'{e}}culo XXI, o Brasil possu{\'{i}}a 16 revistas nessa base. Possivelmente pela concorr{\^{e}}ncia entre empresas imposta ao WoS (Reuters) pelo surgimento da base Scopus (Elsevier) em 2004, v{\'{a}}rios pa{\'{i}}ses e v{\'{a}}rias revistas de diferentes pa{\'{i}}ses adentraram o WoS a partir de 2007, com maior pico em 2009, o que foi acompanhado pelo Brasil (veja gr{\'{a}}ficos em Volpato (1)). Apesar desse grande movimento em dire{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\`{a}} internacionaliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da publica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, o Brasil estava apenas entrando no palco para o grande debate, em que o objetivo era que nossa ci{\^{e}}ncia conseguisse sobressair qualitativamente em rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o aos demais pa{\'{i}}ses.

This article measures the extent of this weakness and analyzes its causes. It focuses especially on the structural changes in the banking sector, the economic crisis of 1992-1993, and the subsequent financial reforms implemented. The evidence gathered by the author shows that the banking reforms initiated since 1994 have produced mixed results. Although central bank autonomy and bank supervision have improved, political, economic, and institutional constraints have prevented the government from taking more decisive measures to re-capitalize banks, restructure the debt of state-owned enterprises, and increase competition in the banking sector quickly. Despite the apparent effectiveness of the short-term measures taken to bolster public confidence in the banking system, China's banking reform will be a difficult and prolonged process.},

abstract = {During the first 90 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, over 675,000 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported, posing unprecedented socioeconomic burden to the country. Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This article uses a multiple regression model to evaluate the extent to which financial resources in various regions can be put into the most appropriate direction through the financial system or financial market. This paper uses the Tobit model to conduct empirical analysis on the input and output data of technology finance in multiple provinces and cities and explores the impact of various factors on technology finance efficiency from the perspective of three technology finance entities: high-tech enterprises, governments, and venture capital companies. Based on the DEA model and Malmquist index model in the data envelopment analysis method, this paper uses deap software to calculate the efficiency of agricultural science and technology resource allocation in Gansu Province and the efficiency of agricultural science and technology operation in many provinces in the western region. This paper divides the allocation of scientific and technological innovation resources into the ability to allocate scientific and technological innovation resources and the allocation efficiency of scientific and technological innovation resources. By constructing a performance evaluation system for the allocation of scientific and technological innovation resources, it is found that there are obvious differences in the ability and efficiency of scientific and technological innovation resource allocation in various regions. This paper proposes the selected efficiency evaluation method, the multiple regression model, which uses the data from 2012 to 2018 to evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of scientific and technological financial resources in my country, calculates the efficiency value of each region, and conducts a comparative analysis of provinces and regions. Research shows that, through multiple regression model analysis, the total technical efficiency of technology finance in Northeast China rose from 0.759 fluctuations in 2012 to 0.922 in 2018, gradually reducing the difference with the eastern and western regions. The overall promotion plays a significant role. The innovation of this article lies in the use of multiple regression models to analyze the factors affecting the allocation of regional scientific and technological financial resources, aiming to improve the efficiency of financial resource allocation.},

Three tests for Granger causality in panel data, proposed respectively by Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988), Granger and Huang (1997) and Hurlin (2005, 2007), are applied to a database of Brazilian states over the period 1981-2007. The main results show that conclusions can be misleading when they are based on the causality tests with homogeneous structure parameters. And so, the test proposed by Hurlin (2005, 2007), which controls the different types of heterogeneity, indicates that in Brazil the evidence is clearer for causality in direction from health to income.},

@article{Mileris2012,
abstract = {The credit risk is one of the main risks in commercial banks and the ability to manage it meaningly affects banks' stability. This risk arises due to the particular reasons related to the possibility to lose loans if the debtors are not able to meet their financial obligations. When making the decisions of financing the loan applicants, banks use the credit risk assessment models that allow estimating the probability of the potential borrowers to default on their loan commitments. The main goal of managing the credit risk in banks is to compound the loan portfolio of the acceptable risk level. According to Derelioglu and Gurgen (2011) the credit risk analysis aims to decrease future losses by estimating the potential risk and eliminating the new credit proposal if the risk is higher than a defined tolerance value. In this respect, it is essential to identify the main factors causing this risk in order to manage it. When assessing the credit risk of every company, banks usually analyze the financial data and some qualitative factors as the independent variables in the statistical credit risk assessment models. But in changing the credit policy in banks and pricing the credits, it is very important to predict the quality of loan portfolio in future. The problem can be summarized as finding the statistical methods that relates the proportion of doubtful and non-performing credits in the loan portfolio (dependent variable) with the set of explanatory variables (macroeconomic information of a country). The aim of this research is to find the macroeconomic determinants that significantly influence the changes of loan portfolio credit risk in banks and to develop the statistical model for prediction of the proportion of doubtful and non-performing loans. The scientific literature analysis results confirmed the influence of macroeconomic conditions on credit risk of debtors in banks and presented that the changes in quality of loan portfolio in banks depend on GDP, inflation, interest rates, money supply, industrial production index, current account balance and other. In empirical research 22 EU countries were grouped into 3 clusters according to their similarity in changes of the doubtful and non-performing loans percentage in banks. The set of 20 independent variables as factors determining the changes in amount of doubtful and non-performing loans was created. These variables were calculated from 9 macroeconomic indicators of 3 years. The model was developed to classify the countries into clusters applying the logistic regression, factor analysis and probit methods. The classification accuracy is 100 %. The predictions of doubtful and non-performing loans indexes are based on the analysis of the scores of extracted 5 factors as new independent variables. The multiple regression and polynomial regression methods were applied for the index predictions in clusters. The developed model in this research enables to predict the percentage of doubtful and non-performing loans in banks with the average 98,06% accuracy. The research has confirmed that the amount of doubtful and non-performing loans in banks highly depends on macroeconomic changes in a country. The model can warn the banks in advance if the significant increase in the loan portfolio credit risk after 2 years is highly possible.},

This policy represents the operationalization of the orthodox economic theory, in which pressures on demand are the main cause of inflation. The goal of this paper is to evaluate if the Structuralist and Post-keynesian theories of inflation are relevant to explain the behavior of the Brazilian inflation. To do so, we analyze the evolution of the main consumer index (IPCA) since 2000 in order to identify which segments were more important to the inflationary rigidity that is characteristic of the Brazil. The main conclusion is that the inflation is mostly in the supply side of the economy, so the interest rate does not solve the causes of inflation and also has negative impacts on economic growth.},

In the environment that has prevailed for at least three decades now, it is not possible to understand business fluctuations and the corresponding analytical and policy challenges without understanding the financial cycle. This calls for a rethink of modelling strategies and for significant adjustments to macroeconomic policies. This essay highlights the stylised empirical features of the financial cycle, conjectures as to what it may take to model it satisfactorily, and considers its policy implications. In the discussion of policy, the essay pays special attention to the bust phase, which is less well explored and raises much more controversial issues. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has become a cornerstone of Indonesia's forest sector policies. Given corruption risks in the sector, a number of policies and initiatives â both specifically linked to REDD+ and to broader national reform efforts â have been launched to ensure that risks of corruption in REDD+ are minimized. Efforts directly linked to REDD+ include clarifying REDD+ regulatory frameworks and institutional arrangements and establishing REDD+ safeguards. Broader reforms relevant to anti-corruption and REDD+ include an initiative to clarify the status of state forests, the development of âone mapâ and âone dataâ policies, and the establishment of a multi-door approach to address forest crimes. This U4 Issue paper assesses the extent to which these reforms actually address corruption risks. Areas where the government of Indonesia and its donor partners could strengthen anti-corruption measures related to REDD+ are also presented. Policy suggestions include (i) anchoring regulatory frameworks and institutional arrangements more securely, (ii) addressing coordination gaps and building subnational government capacity, (iii) clarifying auditing responsibilities and deciding on how REDD+ benefits will be redistributed, (iv) strengthening the role of the Supreme Audit Board in REDD+, (v) encouraging coordination across licensing systems and strengthening incentives and sanctions for all public officials, and (vi) introducing REDD+ to judges.},

We examine the role of various socioeconomic mediating factors, including public health measures that encourage social distancing in local communities. Weather characteristics 2 weeks prior are used as instrumental variables for causal inference. Stringent quarantines, city lockdowns, and local public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the virus transmission rate. The virus spread was contained by the middle of February. Population outflow from the outbreak source region posed a higher risk to the destination regions than other factors, including geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. We quantify the effects of different public health measures in reducing the number of infections through counterfactual analyses. Over 1.4 million infections and 56,000 deaths may have been avoided as a result of the national and provincial public health measures imposed in late January in China.},

abstract = {Nowadays, small-and medium-sized enterprises play crucial roles in both developed and developing countries. They create new employment, fulfill the market gap, contribute to Gross Domestic Product and boost the whole economy. However, small-and medium-sized enterprises face more financial constraints than large enterprises, which prevent them from growing and expanding their activities. This paper aims to investigate how the innovation of small-and medium-sized enterprises impacts on credit accessibility in Vietnam from 2005 to 2015, through five aspects of innovation: new products, new technology, improved existing products, research and development investment, and machine innovation. The data set consists of more than 4500 observations of small-and medium-sized enterprises in Vietnam. This data set is taken from a survey conducted within the framework of cooperation among UNU-WIDER, the University of Copenhagen and Vietnamese government agencies. Using panel regression model, we found out that three out of five innovation factors significantly impact on credit accessibility. More specifically, research and development investment and new product have negative impact on credit accessibility; whereas new technology has positive impact on credit accessibility. These findings are useful for firm managers, banks and policy makers to help small-and medium-sized enterprises overcome financial constraints through innovation aspects.},

abstract = {Various economic theories are available to explain the existence of credit and default cycles. There remains empirical ambiguity, however, as to whether these cycles coincide. Recent papers suggest by their empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaults and credit spreads tend to co-move with macroeconomic variables. If true, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regulation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1933â1997 US data on real GDP, credit spreads and business failure rates to shed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate unobserved components framework to disentangle credit and business cycles. We distinguish two types of cycles in the data, corresponding to periods of around 6 and 11â16 years, respectively. Cyclical co-movements between GDP and business failures mainly arise at the longer frequency. At the higher frequency of 6 years, co-cyclicality is less clear-cut. We also show that spreads reveal a positive and negative co-cyclicality with failure rates and GDP, respectively. This pattern disappears, however, if we concentrate on the post World War II period. We comment on the implications of our findings for credit risk management. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Estimation results suggest that the crisis affected these dynamics differently across banks, which implies that policy implications are uneven. This has important consequences regarding the effectiveness of monetary and the macroprudential policy, which prompt policymakers to consider ownership in policy design. To enhance policy effectiveness, adding ownership-specific explanatory variables may enable better representation of the non-performing loan dynamics. A vintage loan analysis may also help by allowing policymakers to directly identify the loan type, which generates non-performing loans.},

abstract = {The unprecedented rapid aging of the population is poised to become the next global public health challenge, as is apparent by the fact that 23.1% of the total global burden of disease is attributable to disorders in people aged 60 years and older. Aging of the population is the biggest driver of substantial increases in the prevalence of chronic conditions, and the prevalence of multi-morbidity is much higher in older age groups. This places a large burden on countries' health and long-term care systems. Many behavioral changes and public policy responses to aging of the population have been implemented to cope with these challenges. A system of ``aging in place{''} has been implemented in some high-income countries in order to better provide coordinated and cost-effective health services for the elderly. This approach reduces institutional care while supporting home-or community-based care and other services. Advances in information and communications technology (ICT), assistive devices, medical diagnostics, and interventions offer many ways of more efficiently providing long-term care as part of aging in place. The use of big data on a web services platform in an effective collaborative system should promote systematic data gathering to integrate clinical and public health information systems to provide support across the continuum of care. However, the use of big data in collaborative system is a double-edged sword, as it also bring challenges for information sharing, standardized data gathering, and the security of personal information, that warrant full attention.},

abstract = {The main route of transmission of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and presumably also of the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2, is via droplets and close contacts, however their fecal elimination also suggests the possible spread via water. A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water. Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water. In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments. Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 Â°C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the field of innovation studies regarding barriers to low-carbon innovation and consequences for finance (investment and divestment) and contributes to a more holistic understanding of the underlying mechanisms. A combination of technological barriers combined with economic barriers, institutional and political barriers contribute to sub-optimal low-carbon investment all along the innovation cycle. Policy makers need to take a systemic approach to enable the redirection of diverse private financial sources. Instruments range from cutting âdirty' (R&D) subsidies and support for clean technology innovation and diffusion, levelling the institutional playing field and making risks of high-carbon and low-carbon technologies transparent to providing a consistent but adaptive long-term transition strategy. This would allow financiers to gradually shift their investments away from high-carbon mainstream markets and scale low-carbon technology niche-markets. However financiers also need to sharpen their competencies with regard to new clean technologies and markets.},

abstract = {Universities play pivotal roles when research findings are to be adopted commercially. Although these roles vary from one country to another, effective patenting and licensing procedures, as well as eventual commercialisation of scholarly inventions, reflect hard work on the part of the University mediating between the researcher and the industry through technology transfer offices (TTOs) in order to ensure that knowledge-developers take motivational and monetary credit for their findings. This paper details some existing models, processes, and roles taken up in some countries where sharing of intellectual property exists, and links it up with aspects of universityâindustry technology transfer, such as policies surrounding patenting, government investment and marketing, and the process of academic entrepreneurship, among others. 22 articles were found via a systematic review of literature and analysed with respect to four identified areas of focus: internal strategy, investment and market, academic entrepreneurship and policy. Based on models, processes, and roles in reviewed studies, our results indicate that new models for technology transfer mainly stem from the fact that there is no universally accepted model in the literature. Furthermore, management of technology transfer is mostly the responsibility of TTOs in most countries. While university TTOs act as intermediaries to protect the interest of the author/inventor, issues such as poor relationships between universities and industry, as well as funding, remain major challenges in many emerging economies. In contrast, researchers in western economies are mainly challenged by financial motivation and recognition within the academic domains.},

abstract = {President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) into law in 2009. It awarded massive temporary funding for the objective of reviving the national economy. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of some of the ARRA funds in terms of stimulating innovative activities specifically in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. The research question was about whether federal ARRA expenditures issued through decentralized state and local intergovernmental grant programs and designed to spur new energy technologies effectively achieved their legislatively stated objectives. The analysis was based upon a first differenced regression model with instrumental variables using data from 2005 to 2015. The analytical evidence indicates that all else held equal, the ARRA funds successfully stimulated innovative activities in these technology fields. We conclude that a decentralized delivery system conducted through intergovernmental grants can effectively allocate federal expenditures for promoting innovative activity in energytechnology-related fields. We also suggest that short-term and temporary funds such as those supplied by the ARRA can provide a positive longerterm return vis-a-vis innovative activity in these fields.},

@article{Mazzucato2015a,
abstract = {This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both âfinanceâ and âcapital developmentâ very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition â to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge â the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of productionâto complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to âfinancialisation of the real economy,â the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi's famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking âvampire squid.â In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky's ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter's views on financing innovation.},

Abstract The study aims, first, retake the discussion on industrialization and development incorporating neo-schumpeterian approach to theories of ECLAC and the new developmentalism. From the neo-schumpeterian theory it argues that in addition to industrialization we need to consider that the development Happens In long waves, from the incorporation of advanced technologies. Secondly objective is to discuss Brazil since the beginning of the last decade, a period that discusses the possibility of a new era developmental. The conclusions show the fact that Brazil keep losing the participation of industry as a central axis of growth, while it has been shown clearly unable to incorporate the most advanced technologies of the latest technological revolution.},

abstract = {Securitization is a financial innovation that experiences a boom-bust cycle, as many other innovations before. This paper analyzes possible reasons for the breakdown of primary and secondary securitization markets, and argues that misaligned incentives along the value chain are the primary cause of the problems. The illiquidity of asset and interbank markets, in this view, is a market failure derived from ill-designed mechanisms of coordinating financial intermediaries and investors. Thus, illiquidity is closely related to the design of the financial chains. Our policy conclusions emphasize crisis prevention rather than crisis management, and the objective is to restore a comprehensive incentive alignment. The toe-hold for strengthening regulation is surprisingly small. First, we emphasize the importance of equity piece retention for the long-term quality of the underlying asset pool. As a consequence, equity piece allocation needs to be publicly known, alleviating market pricing. Second, on a micro level, accountability of managers can be improved by compensation packages aiming at long term incentives, and penalizing policies with destabilizing effects on financial markets. Third, on a macro level, increased transparency relating to effective risk transfer, risk-related management compensation, and credible measurement of rating performance stabilizes the valuation of financial assets and, hence, improves the solvency of financial intermediaries. Fourth, financial intermediaries, whose risk is opaque, may be subjected to higher capital requirements.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The model rests on the relationship between default rates and the business cycle: by positing two regimes, expansion and recession, and by forecasting the associated probabilities, the default probability for each rating class is defined as the expected value of a default rate whose distribution is a mixture of an expansion and a recession distribution. The application to US data over the forecasting period 1971-2002 provides evidence that the model makes it possible to preserve the risk sensitivity of the capital requirement and at the same time to dampen procyclicality. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This article is intended to identify the variables with the greatest impact on a candidate's odds of being elected to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) in the 2006 elections. Based on data from the Superior Electoral Court, the article begins by analyzing the existence of statistically significant correlations between gender, age, occupation, schooling, and campaign spending on the one hand and the election outcome on the other (elected versus not elected). Next, the article presents a bivariate logistic regression model to measure the real impact of each of these variables on the candidate's outcome. These same procedures were repeated for the parties of the right, center, and left. The conclusion is that being a professional politician is the most important variable in determining a candidate's electoral success in Brazil.},

All of\r\nthe examples in this book are drawn from various subfields in Political Science, with\r\ndata drawn from American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and\r\npublic policy. The datasets come from the types of sources common to political and\r\nsocial research, such as surveys, election returns, legislative roll call votes, nonprofit\r\norganizations' assessments of practices across countries, and field experiments. Of\r\ncourse, while the examples are drawn from Political Science, all of the techniques\r\ndescribed are valid for any discipline.

However, macroeconomic factors rarely, if ever, appear as variables in predictive models that seek to identify distress and failure; modellers generally suggest that the impact of macroeconomic factors has already been taken into account by financial ratio variables. This article presents a systematic study of this domain, by examining the link between the failure of companies and macroeconomic factors for the French companies to identify the most important variables and to estimate their utility in a predictive context. The results of the study suggest that several macroeconomic variables are strictly associated to the failure, and have a predictive value by specifying the relation between the financial distress and the failure.},

abstract = {Background: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (â¥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}10, 95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}03â1{\textperiodcentered}17, per year increase; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5{\textperiodcentered}65, 2{\textperiodcentered}61â12{\textperiodcentered}23; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 $\mu$g/mL (18{\textperiodcentered}42, 2{\textperiodcentered}64â128{\textperiodcentered}55; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20{\textperiodcentered}0 days (IQR 17{\textperiodcentered}0â24{\textperiodcentered}0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 $\mu$g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between macroeconomic fluctuations and corporate defaults while conditioning on industry affiliation and an extensive set of firm-specificfactors. By using a panel data set for virtually all incorporated Swedish businesses over 1990-2009, a period which includes a full-scale banking crisis, we find strong evidence for a substantial and stable impact from aggregate fluctuations on business defaults. A standard logit model with financial ratios augmented with macroeconomic factors can account surprisingly well for the outburst in business defaults during the banking crisis, as well as the subsequent fluctuations in default frequencies. Moreover, the effects of macroeconomic variables differ across industries in an economically intuitive way. Out-of-sample evaluations show that our approach is superior to models that exclude macro information and standard well-fitting time-series models. Our analysis shows that firm-specific factors are useful in ranking firms' relative riskiness,but that macroeconomic factors are necessary to understand fluctuations in the absolute risk level.},

abstract = {We study the employment and sales growth of entrepreneurial ventures that have received a government-sponsored participative loan (PL), a hybrid form of financing between debt and equity. We use propensity-score matching (PSM) and instrumental variable analysis (2SLS) to study a sample of 512 entrepreneurial ventures that received a PL from a Spanish government agency between 2005 and 2011. We find evidence that PLs significantly boosted their beneficiaries' employment and sales. In the two years following loan issuance, a 1-million-Euro PL generated an increase in average employment of between 12.1 (PSM) and 14.7 (2SLS) units and an increase in sales of between 1.09 and 1.97 million Euro relative to the average for the two years prior to loan issuance. The effect is larger for high-tech, young and small entrepreneurial ventures and for those that received a PL during the global financial crisis. The effect on growth is significant and stable, and PLs increase their beneficiaries' annual growth by 10.6% for employment and by 18.0% for sales. We do not find evidence of industry or regional spillovers, nor do we find differences in the probability of survival of PL beneficiaries after we control for their characteristics.},

In the process of research such scientific methods have been used: modeling - to determine the influence of the source of funding for innovation activities, on the number of new technological processes introduced and the introduction of new types of products; economic-statistical - to evaluate the dynamics of the amount of realized innovative products and the index of the efficiency of innovation costs; correlation-regression analysis - to determine the relationship density and the relationship between factors of influence and performance indicators; abstract-logical - for the implementation of theoretical and methodological generalizations. The results of the research - analyzed the connection of the indexes of dynamics of sources of financing of innovation activity and the amount of implemented new technological processes and development of new types of products for 2011-2017. The influence of the most significant sources of financing on the amount of innovations is described. Further development of methodological and practical aspects of the dependence of the amount of implemented innovative products and the index of the efficiency of innovation costs, using multiple regression models, has been found for the establishment of the influence of system-based economic indexes. The practical significance of the obtained results is to determine the optimal level of financial support for innovation activity of enterprises, which will allow to predict the growth of innovative processes in the country in the short and medium term.},

abstract = {Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17â45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34â58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24â65% (and peak deaths 15â69%), compared to 2â9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9â18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Two main themes emerged from the panel: the challenges of high cost and low participation which many e-participation initiatives have faced; and the potential Big Data seems to hold for remedying these problems. This introduction briefly presents these themes and links them to the papers in the issue. It argues that Big Data can fix some of the problems typically encountered by e-participation initiatives: it can offer a solution to the problem of low turnout which is furthermore accessible to government bodies even if they have low levels of financial resources. However, the use of Big Data in this way is also a radically different approach to the problem of involving citizens in policymaking; and the editorial concludes by reflecting on the significance of this for the policymaking process.},

abstract = {This paper examines the growing recognition of the phenomenon called
``Big Data{''} and the policy implications it poses. It is argued that a
core policy issue is personal and organizational privacy. At the same
time there is a belief that analysis of ``Big Data{''} offers
potentially to provide public sector policy makers with extensive new
information that would inform policy at unprecedentedly detailed levels.
Despite this potential to improve the policy-making process data often
contain individual identifiable information that would negatively impact
American core values such as privacy. This makes the use of these data
almost impossible. The paper recognizes that there may be a way to strip
individual data from Big Data sets thereby making their analysis more
policy useful. This approach is not at this time technically feasible
but research is ongoing.},

abstract = {This paper uses information on the productive structure of each of Mexico's states to calculate a measure of economic complexity using the Method of Reflections proposed by Hausmann and Hidalgo (2009). The results suggest that the country's states differ markedly in terms of the activities they specialize in, and therefore also in terms of their economic complexity. There is also a clear regional pattern which shows that states in the north are more complex, those in the central region have an intermediate level of complexity, and those in the south have the lowest levels of complexity. As previous international studies have shown, complexity is an important factor in explaining the economic disparities observed in the country, given that its measure is positively related to both the level of wealth and the growth rate of the states. Therefore, we can assert that the dispersion of productive knowledgeâmeasured according to the specialization of the states or the location of the various economic activities performed thereâgoes some way toward explaining their different patterns of growth.},

While methodological sciences have no object and are supposed to adopt a hypothetical-deductive method, substantive sciences including economics should use an empirical or historicaldeductive method. The great classical economists and Keynes did that and were able to develop open models explaining how equally open economic systems work. Thus, the hard core of relevant economics is formed by the classical microeconomics and the classical theory of capitalist economic growth, and by Keynesian macroeconomics. In contrast, neoclassical economist aiming to build a mathematical science wrongly adopted the hypothetical-deductive method, and came to macroeconomic and growth models that do not have practical use in policymaking. The exception is Marshall's microeconomics that does not provide a model of real economic systems, but is useful to the analysis of markets.},

With the Theory of Regulation we observe the contribution of the institutional forms of structure for the persistence and the end of inflation in Brazil. From the point of view of Veblen's institutionalism we show that the institutional forms have contributed in consolidating what is called inflation habit, present in Brazil throughout its history and that has increased relevance in the 1980's decade, which has derailed the Cruzado Plan. On the other hand, the Real Plan has succeeded in controlling inflation since it eliminated the practice of raising prices, and it was benefited for the new configuration of the institutional forms.},

abstract = {Latest version available here This paper uses daily death registry data from 4,000 Italian municipalities to zoom in on two crucial policies that can dramatically affect the toll of COVID-19: the shutdown of non-essential businesses and the management of the emergency care system. Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that the closure of service activities is very effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality-this was about 15% lower in municipalities with a 10 percentage points higher employment share in shut down services. Shutting down factories, instead, is much less effective, plausibly because factory workers engage in more limited physical interactions relative to those in the consumer-facing service sector. Concerning the management of the health care system, we find that mortality strongly increases with distance from the intensive care unit (ICU). Municipalities at 10 km from the closest ICU experienced up to 50% higher mortality. This effect-which is strongest within the epicenter and in days of abnormally high volumes of calls to the emergency line-underscores the importance of improving pre-hospital emergency services and building ambulance capacity to ensure timely transportation of critical patients to the ICU. seminar participants at CEIBS and the OECD for helpful feedbacks and engagement on the paper.},

abstract = {The magnitude of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has an enormous impact on the social life and the economic activities in almost every country in the world. Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude of social and economic criteria also govern the extent of the coronavirus disease spread in the population. Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the resulting pandemic. In this paper, we contribute towards the resolution of the debate by leveraging Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 29 determinants, describing a diverse set of socio-economic characteristics, in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome. We show that the true empirical model behind the coronavirus outcome is constituted only of few determinants, but the extent to which each determinant is able to provide a credible explanation varies between countries due to their heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics. To understand the relationship between the potential determinants in the specification of the true model, we develop the coronavirus determinants Jointness space. In this space, two determinants are connected with each other if they are able to jointly explain the coronavirus outcome. As constructed, the obtained map acts as a bridge between theoretical investigations and empirical observations, and offers an alternate view for the joint importance of the socio-economic determinants when used for developing policies aimed at preventing future epidemic crises.},

abstract = {This paper offers an alternative explanation to the slow-down observed in the growth of developing countries. Instead of a middle-income trap what happened was a liberalization trap. Growth didn't happen because countries turned middle-income, but happened in a given period, around the 1980s, when these countries faced a serious foreign debt crisis and were constrained to open their economies. The studies on the middle-income trap have adopted a broad income interval and were unable to offer new historical facts that explained why these countries stop growing fast. Differently, this paper shows that the trade liberalization and the financial liberalization that started in the 1980s involved the dismantling of the mechanism that neutralized the Dutch disease and the change from low to high interest rates â both facts leading to a long-term or chronic overvaluation of the exchange rate that made the manufacturing industry non-competitive and caused deindustrialization and low growth.},

This paper focuses, in particular, on those market failures which arise from imperfect information (as in the capital market) or which are almost inevitably associated with the learning which must occur if the less developed countries are successfully to make the transition to being more developed. learning, Among the consequences of learning-by-doing, of localized and of learning-to-learn are imperfections of competition, multiple equilibria, hysteresis, and the optimality of non-myopic policies. These market failures are markedly different from those that were the center of attention in earlier literature, which led to arguments for government planning. Government interventions need to recognize the source of market failures; informational problems affect the government no less than the private sector. In some cases, interventions should be directed at making markets work more effectively; in other cases, the government may take a role in establishing non-market institutions to ameliorate the effects of market failure.},

This article examines the effect of trade credit maintaining sustainable R & D investment of SMEs under financial constraints. Using the panel data of Chinese SMEs from 2002-2014, it was found that although the R & D investments of SMEs are restricted by financial constraints, trade credit can maintain the sustainability of enterprises' R & D investment. Private enterprises are more reliant on trade credit, which can be intensified during periods of monetary tightening. Considering the counterfactual framework and the endogenous problems, the empirical results were also robust when using propensity score matching. To summarize, this article develops a new explanation for maintaining sustainable R & D investment of SMEs under financial constraints in developing countries.},

Based on RAIS' microdata regarding to the period 2007-2013, we selected a sample of industrial establishments homogeneous in their economic structure divided between participants in the program (treatment group) and non-participants (control group). The Survival Analysis technique coupled with the PSM identified that participant establishments in the SIMPLES program born in 2007 has 30% less probability of death than non-participants. Disaggregating industrial establishments by the level of technological intensity, the paper suggests as the main outcome that the program has a different impact between the groups: with the industrial sectors of low and medium-low technology being the only affected by the program.},

@article{Reinert2012,
abstract = {This article provides a historical and theoretical overview of the mechanisms leading up to financial crises and financial bubbles. It suggests that the potentially explosive growth of the financial sector at the expense of the real economy fed by compound interest has - since before Ancient Mesopotamia under the rule of Hammurabi - represented a real threat for such crises. A more modern and additional factor that builds up crises is Joseph Schumpeter's observation of the clustering of innovations. Carlota Perez has more recently developed Schumpeter's vision into a theory of techno-economic paradigms which - about midway in their trajectory - produce a build-up to financial crises. The theories of Schumpeterian economist Hyman Minsky, which describe the mechanisms leading to the collapse of financial bubbles, complete the overview. The article ends with recommendations to bring the West out of the present crisis by -once again - putting the real economy, rather than the financial economy, in the driver's seat of capitalism.},

abstract = {The authors raise the actual problem of weak intersectoral interaction of subjects of the financial-credit and innovation sectors of Kazakhstan. Currently, asymmetric processes are observed not only in the interaction of two strategically important sectors for the economy, but also in the asymmetric nature of the impact of regulatory instruments on the process of their interaction. This is a consequence of a largely non-integrated and disproportionate government policy, which in recent years has been characterized by onesidedness and narrow focus in stimulating and supporting certain sectors and industries. In this regard, the authors carried out a three-level assessment of dependencies to determine the degree of influence of innovation activity on the rate of economic growth, the degree of influence of financial-credit organizations on the results of innovation activity and the degree of influence of the current regulatory instruments on the investment activity of the financial sector. As a result of the construction and use of an econometric model, results were obtained that confirm the hypothesis formulated by the authors about the creative role of systemic regulation, but also reveal the existing potential and points of convergence of financial-credit organizations with the innovative sector of the economy.},

@article{Hausmann2011,
abstract = {Much of the analysis of economic growth has focused on the study of aggregate output. Here, we deviate from this tradition and look instead at the structure of output embodied in the network connecting countries to the products that they export. We characterize this network using four structural features: the negative relationship between the diversification of a country and the average ubiquity of its exports, and the non-normal distributions for product ubiquity, country diversification and product co-export. We model the structure of the network by assuming that products require a large number of non-tradable inputs, or capabilities, and that countries differ in the completeness of the set of capabilities they have. We solve the model assuming that the probability that a country has a capability and that a product requires a capability are constant and calibrate it to the data to find that it accounts well for all of the network features except for the heterogeneity in the distribution of country diversification. In the light of the model, this is evidence of a large heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities across countries. Finally, we show that the model implies that the increase in diversification that is expected from the accumulation of a small number of capabilities is small for countries that have a few of them and large for those with many. This implies that the forces that help drive divergence in product diversity increase with the complexity of the global economy when capabilities travel poorly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Objective: This study investigates the regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 in Brazil and its relationship with climatic and demographic factors by use data from February 26 to April 04, 2020. Methods: A Polynomial Regression Model with cubic adjustments of the number of days of contagion, demographic density, city population and climatic factors was designed and used to explain the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. Main results: It was evidenced that temperature variation maintains a relationship with the reduction in the number of cases of COVID-19. A variation -3.4% in the number of COVID-19 cases was found for each increase of 1 C. Conclusion: There are evidences that the temperature, has a relative effect in the variation in the number of COVID-19's researched cases. For the reason, it recommends this relationship deserves to be investigated in other tests with more extended time series, wide and with especially non-linear data adjustments.

@article{Keen2011a,
abstract = {Debunking Economics - Revised and Expanded Edition, now including a downloadable supplement for courses, exposes what many non-economists may have suspected and a minority of economists have long known: that economic theory is not only unpalatable, but also plain wrong. When the original Debunking Economics was published back in 2001, the market economy seemed invincible, and conventional "neoclassical" economic theory basked in the limelight. Steve Keen argued that economists deserved none of the credit for the economy's performance, and "The false confidence it has engendered in the stability of the market economy has encouraged policy-makers to dismantle some of the institutions which initially evolved to try to keep its instability within limits." That instability exploded with the devastating financial crisis of 2007, and now haunts the global economy with the prospect of another Depression. In this expanded and updated new edition, Keen builds on his scathing critique of conventional economic theory while explaining what mainstream economists cannot: why the crisis occurred, why it is proving to be intractable, and what needs to be done to end it. Essential for anyone who has ever doubted the advice or reasoning of economists, Debunking Economics - Revised and Expanded Edition provides a signpost to a better future.},

abstract = {Objectives: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors including patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, and adherence to social distancing have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains. Methods: Data on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths. Results: Univariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths. Conclusions: U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

These policies triggered concerns over the impact of debt financing on firms' technological innovation activities. Based on a sample of 225 listed computer and telecommunications equipment firms in China within 2008â2015, this study explored the effect of debt financing on two types of technological innovation, namely radical and incremental innovation. Specifically, both the direct effect of debt financing on technological innovation and its moderating effect on the relationship between R&D intensity and technological innovation were investigated. Results of this study reveal that radical innovation decreases with debt financing at decreasing rates, while incremental innovation is not affected by debt financing itself. In addition, debt financing interacted with R&D intensity exerts positive effect on both radical and incremental innovation. This study adds meaningful insights to the literature on financing technological innovation and builds a bridge connecting macroeconomic policies to firm activities.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers and policy makers to identify public safety measures forpreventing the collapse of healthcare systems and reducingdeaths. This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on the impact of social distancing measures on the epidemic and discusses the implementation of these measures in Brazil. Articles on the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 were selected from the PubMed, medRXiv and bioRvix databases. Federal and state legislation was analyzed to summarize the strategies implemented in Brazil. Social distancing measures adopted by the population appear effective, particularly when implemented in conjunction with the isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts. Therefore, social distancing measures, and social protection policies to guarantee the sustainability of these measures, should be implemented. To control COVID-19 in Brazil, it is also crucial that epidemiological monitoring is strengthened at all three levels of the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). This includes evaluating and usingsupplementary indicators to monitor the progression of the pandemic and the effect of the control measures, increasing testing capacity, and making disaggregated notificationsand testing resultstransparentand broadly available.

Moreover, it contains empirical evidence of more lenient credit standards during boom periods, both in terms of screening of borrowers and in collateral requirements. We find robust evidence that during upturns, riskier borrowers get bank loans, while collateralized loans decrease. We develop a regulatory prudential tool, based on a countercyclical, or forward-looking, loan loss provision that takes into account the credit risk profile of banks loan portfolios along the business cycle. Such a provision might contribute to reinforce the soundness and the stability of banking systems.},

abstract = {Setting off from an Evolutionary perspective, this paper debates key aspects of the process of financing innovation based on Keynes's asset choice model within the context of Minsky's cycle and the Institutionalist approach of Veblen. Innovative activity is surrounded by great uncertainty because firms invest funds for the long term without being sure whether they will earn high returns. As a result, firms run into additional obstacles when trying to obtain financing to develop new technologies. This difference becomes clearer when developed countries (USA) and less-developed countries (Brazil) are compared. The higher the level of uncertainty in world markets, the lower the amount of funds available to finance innovation; and this situation is accentuated in less-developed countries because they do not have a mature financial system capable of supporting innovation risks.},

abstract = {This paper provides evidence on the likelihood of formal finance usage among innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in ASEAN countries. To this end, the SMEs are classified into four categories, namely non-innovators and product, process, and product-and-process innovator SMEs. Subsequently, a propensity score weighting (PSW) analysis is performed to adjust for diversity existing across innovative SMEs. The resulting propensity scores are further used to perform the causal effect analysis based on the average treatment effect (ATE) approach, which measures the likelihood of formal finance usage among different types of innovative SMEs. Our ATE results reveal that SMEs simultaneously engaged in product and process innovation show a higher likelihood of using formal finance than non-innovators. However, formal finance usage of SMEs perusing only product/service or process innovation is not any different from non-innovators. Furthermore, our pairwise analysis shows that product and process innovators also exhibit a higher likelihood of formal finance usage than product/service or process innovators. Besides, younger and medium-size product and process innovating SMEs are more likely to use formal finance. These results are robust for different subsamples and firm- and country-level controls.},

The paper presents an application of the different notion of resilience to the case of Spanish provinces in the last years. We find that provinces with sectoral structure and location advantages, or those with locational advantages in the post-crisis period (according to the " adaptative " resilience measure), exhibit a significantly lower " drop " in growth (according to the " engineering " and " ecological " resilience measure). Furthermore, we conclude that the probability of presenting a better behavior (lower " drop " in growth than the average) increases for those regions specialized in the service sector before the crisis. As expected, the worse behavior has correspond to those regions specialized in the pre-crisis period in the construction sector.},

This article analyzes the relationship between the behavior of credit defaults and the cyclical variations in economic activity in Brazil. Using monthly data ranging from 2001 to 2013, a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) was estimated to analyze the credit cycles in the indicated time period. The results show that a positive income shock stimulates credit concessions and reduces charge-off ratios in the short run, but, in the long-run, a reduced credit rationing is followed by a greater risk exposure by the financial institutions.},

The aim of this article is to provide a better understanding of long-term uneven resilience by critically exploring the notions of adaptation and adaptability. Moving beyond the conventional trade-off assumption, the article proposes three main types of adaptation-adaptability relationships: Competing, Separated and Reciprocal, as an analytical approach to explain uneven regional resilience. Two empirical case studies of municipal-level mining regions with a common crisis of coal exhaustion in China, namely Zaozhuang and Fuxin, show how variations of adaptation-adaptability relationships result in uneven resilience.},

@article{Mazzucato2015a,
abstract = {This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both âfinanceâ and âcapital developmentâ very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition â to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge â the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of productionâto complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to âfinancialisation of the real economy,â the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi's famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking âvampire squid.â In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky's ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter's views on financing innovation.},

abstract = {This research addresses the study of the effect of regional factors in the development of eco-innovations in the firm. We assume the hypothesis of regional heterogeneity, that is, geographical factors and the regional heterogeneity play an important role in determining the innovations in the firms. In this line, we will approach our study from the perspective of regional innovation systems (RISs). Therefore, our research question involves the evaluation of regional factors as determinants of eco-innovation developing in the firm. To examine these questions, the PITEC database that covers the period 2011â2013 was used. Overall, 5,461 firms have been employed for the ordinal logit regression model. This research contributes to the studies of eco-innovation, extending the investigation into drivers of eco-innovation, and highlights the impact that RIS has on the eco-innovative development in the firm. We find that regional interaction and regional characteristics are key elements for the development of eco-innovation in firms. Thus, the density of companies in the region, the regional per capita income, and the existence of financing mechanisms are key elements for the eco-innovative development in the firm.},

In this paper we focus on a topic which has been attracting renewed interest because of monetary unification in Europe: the regional dimension of national monetary policies. Most of the debate over the regional implications of the Euro has been developed within the Optimum Currency Area framework. According to this theory, European monetary policy would have regional effects when the countries of the Euro-zone had such structural differences as to produce asymmetric shocks. These asymmetrical effects could only be offset by labour mobility and wage/price flexibility. However, we argue here that, in addition, European monetary policy may have more general regional effects, including in particular by producing a higher instability in the pattern of credit availability for some peripheral regions. This latter possibility, and the forces underlying it, are explored here both at the theoretical level and the empirical level, examining the process by which monetary policy is transmitted.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pandemics and disasters can result in large numbers of critically ill or injured patients who may overwhelm available resources despite implementing surge-response strategies. If this occurs, critical care triage, which includes both prioritizing patients for care and rationing scarce resources, will be required. Th e suggestions in this chapter are important for all who are involved in large-scale pandemics or disasters with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. M ETHODS: Th e Triage topic panel reviewed previous task force suggestions and the literature to identify 17 key questions for which specific literature searches were then conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of sufficient quality were identified. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. Suggestions from the previous task force that were not being updated were also included for validation by the expert panel. RESULTS: Th e suggestions from the task force outline the key principles upon which critical care triage should be based as well as a path for the development of the plans, processes, and infrastructure required. Th is article provides 11 suggestions regarding the principles upon which critical care triage should be based and policies to guide critical care triage. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and efficient critical care triage is a complex process that requires significant planning and preparation. At present, the prognostic tools required to produce an effective decision support system (triage protocol) as well as the infrastructure, processes, legal protections, and training are largely lacking in most jurisdictions. Therefore, critical care triage should be a last resort aft er mass critical care surge strategies.},

We build on a new approach to innovation policy, which we call market co-creating and shaping, in which the state is not only fixing markets but actively co-creating them. We also look at the legal institutions that determine (and are determined by) the relationship between public and private actors. Policy measures to institutionalize rewards in a way that promote more equitable publicâprivate partnerships can be understood as attempts to mediate asymmetric power relations, tensions and conflicting views among multiple stakeholders, as well as building a shared notion of the value and legitimacy of the role of the state. We conclude by outlining analytical and policy implications and identifying avenues for future research.},

The paper's fundamental question is to what extent the catching-up process in these countries can be understood as the application of a new-developmentalist strategy, taking each country's particular historical traits into account.RESUMO O objetivo deste artigo {\'{e}} analisar o processo de catching-up da Coreia do Sul e da China p{\'{o}}s-reformas de 1978 a partir de uma abordagem novo-desenvolvimentista que considere quatro fatores fundamentais: 1) uma rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de complementaridade entre Estado e mercado como um processo din{\^{a}}mico que se altera ao longo do tempo; 2) necess{\'{a}}ria complementaridade entre pol{\'{i}}tica macroecon{\^{o}}mica e pol{\'{i}}tica industrial; 3) papel fundamental do Estado dos bancos de desenvolvimento no enfrentamento do problema do âfinanciamento do desenvolvimentoâ; e destaque {\`{a}} 4) centralidade da taxa de c{\^{a}}mbio e do manejo na administra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do balan{\c{c}}o e pagamentos no processo de desenvolvimentos desses pa{\'{i}}ses.

abstract = {The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented example of how fast an infectious disease can spread around the globe (especially in urban areas) and the enormous impact it causes on public health and socio-economic activities. Despite the recent surge of investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate that large cities are proportionally more affected by COVID-19, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with 0.57% increase in the number of cases per capita and 0.25% in the number of deaths per capita. The difference between the scaling of cases and deaths indicates the case fatality rate decreases with city size. The latest estimates show that a 1% increase in population associates with a 0.14% reduction in the case fatality rate of COVID-19; however, this urban advantage has decreased over time. We interpret this to be due to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in small ones during the long-term course of the pandemic.},

@article{Wu2020,
abstract = {Background: Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23â24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). Findings: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2{\textperiodcentered}68 (95% CrI 2{\textperiodcentered}47â2{\textperiodcentered}86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304â130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6{\textperiodcentered}4 days (95% CrI 5{\textperiodcentered}8â7{\textperiodcentered}1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227â805), 113 (57â193), 98 (49â168), 111 (56â191), and 80 (40â139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1â2 weeks. Interpretation: Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. Funding: Health and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).},

All healthcare facilities need to have policies and plans in place for early identification of patients with a highly communicable diseases which are highly virulent, ability to immediately isolate such patients, and provide proper management (e.g., training and availability of personal protective equipment) to prevent transmission to healthcare personnel, other patients and visitors to the healthcare facility.},

abstract = {Persistence in innovation has been explained by three theoretical approaches: i) sunk costs in research and development (R&D), ii) financial constraints, and iii) innovation capabilities. This research aims to evaluate the effect of determinants proposed by these three approaches on the occurrence of persistence in the imitation of innovations in products in manufacturing industries. To achieving this goal are used research data from three surveys of innovation and technological development of Colombia (EDIT) and one zero inflate ordered probit models is estimated (ZIOP). The results obtained show that sunk costs do not explain the persistence imitation. On the other hand, the continuous access to internal and external financial resources are essentials for this persistence. Finally, the capabilities approach, which is associated with learning forms indicates that interacting lerning and training explain the ocurrence of persistence in the imitation of innovations in products.},

The article shows how in the case of innovation, successful policies that have led to radical innovations have been more about market shaping and creating through direct and pervasive public financing, rather than market fixing. The paper reviews and discusses evidence for this in three key areas: (i) the presence of finance from public sources across the entire innovation chain; (ii) the concept of 'mission-oriented' policies that have created new technological and industrial landscapes; and (iii) the entrepreneurial and lead investor role of public actors, willing and able to take on extreme risks, independent of the business cycle. We further illustrate these three characteristics for the case of clean technology, and discuss how a market-creating and -shaping perspective may be useful for understanding the financing of transformative innovation needed for confronting contemporary societal challenges.},

This paper attempts to broaden the scope of the debate by considering the credit creating behaviour of the banking sector together with the (interdependent) financial behaviour of all other sectors in a region. It is concluded that financial behaviour in this broad sense affects regional activity even in an integrated national financial market. In particular, financial integration may adversely affect the allocation of new credit to a peripheral region. The argument is assessed by considering the Scottish case.},

In the Post-Keynesian literature, endogenous money is introduced into economic activity through the credit provided by banks. The degree to which banks exhibit lower or higher liquidity preference is crucial to this process. Here we estimate the effect of liquidity preference and other financial variables on the number of Brazilian states' patents, in order to gauge the importance of the bank system to technological progress and regional development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The aim of this research is to analyse (i) influence of cooperation with different partners and public funding on firms' willingness to innovate; (ii) how public funding and cooperation with different partners influence firms' innovation performance (turnover); (iii) effects of mutual interactions between firms' innovation activities, cooperation with different partners and public funding on firms' innovation performance (measured with turnover). The situation of 561 firms in Machines and Equipment industries in Germany was analysed because it is one of the most competitive economy in the world and one of the leaders in innovation within European Union. It allows to create unique benchmark and to propose implications that will be more appropriate and applicable also in other countries. For analyses, the data from Community Innovation Survey 2012â2014, which is a harmonized questionnaire and provides EU's science and technology statistics, was used, and new binary and multiple linear regression models were employed. Results of analyses show that provision of public subsidies, unlike cooperation, strongly influence firm's motivation to innovate. However, results also showed that supported innovation activities do not always lead to an increase in firms' innovative performance. Therefore, it can be pointed to the phenomenon of inefficiency of public innovation support in final consequence.},

abstract = {We study analytically and numerically Minsky instability as a combination of top-down, bottom-up and peer-to-peer positive feedback loops. The peer-to-peer interactions are represented by the links of a network formed by the connections between firms, contagion leading to avalanches and percolation phase transitions propagating across these links. The global parameter in the top-bottom, bottom-up feedback loop is the interest rate. Before the Minsky moment, in the Minsky Loans Accelerator stage, the relevant bottom parameter representing the individual firms micro-states is the quantity of loans. After the Minsky moment, in the Minsky Crisis Accelerator stage, the relevant bottom parameters are the number of ponzi units / quantity of failures, defaults. We represent the top-bottom, bottom-up interactions on a plot similar to the Marshal-Walras diagram for quantity-price market equilibrium (where the interest rate is the analog of the price). The Minsky instability is then simply emerging as a consequence of the fixed point (the intersection of the supply and demand curves) being unstable (repulsive). In the presence of network effects, one obtains more than one fixed point and a few dynamic regimes (phases). We describe them and their implications for understanding, predicting and steering economic instability.},

abstract = {Background: The first case of COVID-19 was detected in Brazil on February 25, 2020. We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8%), two thirds (66.9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by a FAPESP (2018/14389-0) and Medical Research Council and CADDE partnership award (MR/S0195/1).

abstract = {The discipline of Anglo-American economic geogra- phy seems to care little about its history. Its practitio- ners tend toward the âjust do itâ school of scholarship, in which a concern with the present moment in eco- nomic geography subordinates all else. In contrast, I argue that it is vital to know economic geography's history. Historical knowledge of our discipline enables us to realize that we are frequently âslaves of some defunctâ economic geographer; that we cannot escape our geography and history, which seep into the very pores of the ideas that we profess; and that the full connotations of economic geographic ideas are sometimes purposively hidden, secret even, revealed only later by investigative historical scholarship. My antidote: ânotes from the underground,â which means a history of economic geography that delves below the reported surface. This history is often subversive, contradicting conventional depictions; it is antiration- alist, querying universal (timeless) foundations; it seeks out deliberately hidden and buried economic geographic practices, relying on sources literally found undergroundâpersonal papers and correspon- dence stored in one subterranean archive or another. To exemplify the importance of notes from the underground, I present an extended case studyâ the 20th-century development of central place theory, associated with two economic geographers: the German, Walter Christaller (1893â1969), and the American, Edward L. Ullman (1912â76).ecge_1140 1..26},

abstract = {Background: There has been much debate about the effectiveness of lockdown measures in containing COVID-19, and their appropriateness given the economic and social cost they entail. To the best of our knowledge, no existing contribution to the literature has attempted to gauge the effectiveness of lockdown measures over time in a longitudinal cross-country perspective. Objectives: This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing, at an international level, the effect of lockdown measures (or the lack of such measures) on the numbers of new infections. Given this policy's expected change in effectiveness over time, we also measure the effect of having a lockdown implemented over a given number of days (from 7 to 20Â days). Methods: We pursue our objectives by means of a quantitative panel analysis, building a longitudinal dataset with observations from countries all over the world, and estimating the impact of lockdown via feasible generalized least squares fixed effect, random effects, generalized estimating equation, and hierarchical linear models. Results: Our results show that lockdown is effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implement it, compared with those countries that do not. This is especially true around 10Â days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to grow up to 20Â days after implementation. Conclusion: Results suggest that lockdown is effective in reducing the R0, i.e. the number of people infected by each infected person, and that, unlike what has been suggested in previous analyses, its efficacy continues to hold 20Â days after the introduction of the policy.},

abstract = {Despite the efforts to enhance adoption of innovative technologies (IT) by the Tunisian Government through national and/or international development projects, the potential rate of adoption of these technologies has remained low among farmers. This study aims at shedding some light on the potential factors that influence IT adoption in the Tunisian arid areas. Technological, economic, institutional factors and human specific factors (social) are selected to be the determinants of agricultural technology adoption. A quantitative approach employing a cross-sectional design was used to gather data. Stratified random sampling was employed and a total of 200 small-scale farmers (100 adopters and 100 non-adopters) were sampled. Data analysis and assessment was done through descriptive and statistical inferential analysis, and econometric modeling using the binary logistic regression model. Empirical findings show that economic and socio-demographic factors such as farmer education, size of cattle flocks and off-farm income were statistically significant and had positive influence on technology adoption while age and farmer experience had significant and negative effects on IT adoption. The findings confirm the important role of institutional factors (being a member of an association, benefiting from extension services and source of technology knowledge) in the adoption decision of IT, particularly when such variables were found to be significant and positives. In contrast, labor and credit services do not significantly influence adoption of IT. Based on these results, Government should focus on educating young farmers with large cattle flock size and off-farm income to enhance the adoption of IT for livestock holders. It should also intensify training programs for farmers and for extension agents with the collaboration of the project managers and the involvement of the profession and the private sector. Finally, the open innovation strategy including all stakeholders during idea generation could be considered as a better way to decrease technology development costs and improve IT adoption.},

abstract = {Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning. The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems. The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples, and every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process. This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner's reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses. To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book's R package. This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.},

Como en estudios an-teriores, rentabilidad, rotaci{\'{o}}n, endeudamiento y flujo de fondos operativos explican la probabilidad de crisis financiera. La contribuci{\'{o}}n de esta nueva metodolog{\'{i}}a reduce la tasa de error del tipo I a un 9 %.

abstract = {Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The study was funded by Army Logistics Emergency Scientific Research Project; Emergency scientific research of the army and the emergency scientific research of Chinese PLA General Hospital (20EP008). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

abstract = {Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are crucial for local economic development, playing a noteworthy role in job creation, poverty alleviation and economic growth, but they encounter many funding barriers. The purpose of the current paper is to investigate the impact of investments and innovation on territorial economic growth, as measured by turnover, for Romanian active enterprises, especially SMEs, over the period 2009-2017. By estimating several log-log linear regressions, the quantitative outcomes provide support for a positive influence of investments on turnover. The association was confirmed both for all active enterprises at the national level, as well as for micro, small, middle-sized and big companies. As regards expenditures on innovation, a positive impact on turnover was acknowledged for all enterprises and particularly for big companies, but there was an absence of any statistically significant relation in the case of SMEs. The impact of firm size on turnover was positive for all active enterprises at the national level, along with active micro-units. Also, the estimation results show a positive impact of the number of active micro-units on territorial economic growth. The empirical findings are relevant to managers and policymakers in order to stimulate, encourage and offer support to SMEs' development through their strategies.},

abstract = {Background: The burden of H1N1 among socially disadvantaged populations is unclear. We aimed to synthesize hospitalization, severe illness, and mortality data associated with pandemic A/H1N1/2009 among socially disadvantaged populations. Methods/Principal Findings: Studies were identified through searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, scanning reference lists, and contacting experts. Studies reporting hospitalization, severe illness, and mortality attributable to laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 pandemic among socially disadvantaged populations (e.g., ethnic minorities, low-income or lower-middle-income economy countries [LIC/LMIC]) were included. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (Newcastle Ottawa Scale). Random effects meta-analysis was conducted using SAS and Review Manager. Conclusions/Significance: Sixty-two studies including 44,777 patients were included after screening 787 citations and 164 full-text articles. The prevalence of hospitalization for H1N1 ranged from 17-87% in high-income economy countries (HIC) and 11-45% in LIC/LMIC. Of those hospitalized, the prevalence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality was 6-76% and 1-25% in HIC; and 30% and 8-15%, in LIC/LMIC, respectively. There were significantly more hospitalizations among ethnic minorities versus non-ethnic minorities in two studies conducted in North America (1,313 patients, OR 2.26 [95% CI: 1.53-3.32]). There were no differences in ICU admissions (n = 8 studies, 15,352 patients, OR 0.84 [0.69-1.02]) or deaths (n = 6 studies, 14,757 patients, OR 0.85 [95% CI: 0.73-1.01]) among hospitalized patients in HIC. Sub-group analysis indicated that the meta-analysis results were not likely affected by confounding. Overall, the prevalence of hospitalization, severe illness, and mortality due to H1N1 was high for ethnic minorities in HIC and individuals from LIC/LMIC. However, our results suggest that there were little differences in the proportion of hospitalization, severe illness, and mortality between ethnic minorities and non-ethnic minorities living in HIC. {\textcopyright} 2012 Tricco et al.},

abstract = {For various reasons, it is important, if not essential, to integrate the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions, simulations, etc. with the documents that describe and rely on them. This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software framework for authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents, including figures, tables, etc., can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or ``source'' document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. \n\nWe introduce the concept of a compendium as both a container for the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the collection. \n\nThe step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution and use of such reproducible research are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, 3,493 non-financial listed companies in China from 2007 to 2018 are selected as samples to study the impact of corporate financialization on green technology innovation through the panel regression model as well as the mediating effect model, so as to identify whether enterprises tend to financial speculation or capital investment. The main conclusions are as follows. First, corporate financialization has a speculative tendency instead of strategic capital investment. Second, corporate financialization shows heterogeneous impact on green technology innovation, which is dominated by capital expenditure. Third, the heterogeneity is reflected in two aspects: attribute characteristics and external environment. The attribute characteristics of the enterprise includes whether the industry belongs to pollution industry and the ownership structure. The external environment includes the location of enterprise and the degree of financing constraints. Fourth, there are significant differences between attribute characteristics and external environment of enterprises in the impact of financialization decision-making behavior. The deviation caused by enterprise attributes is less than 10%, but the deviation caused by external environment is close to 80%.},

The catalog prerequisites for the course are a full year of calculus. The book can be subdivided into three basic parts. The first part includes the introductions and elementary descriptive statistics; I want the students to be knee-deep in data right out of the gate. The second part is the study of probability, which begins at the basics of sets and the equally likely model, journeys past discrete/continuous random variables, and continues through to multivariate distributions. The chapter on sampling distributions paves the way to the third part, which is in- ferential statistics. This last part includes point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and finishes with introductions to selected topics in applied statistics.},

@article{Shumway2001,
abstract = {This article describes a hazard model that can be used for forecasting bankruptcy. Static models are inappropriate for forecasting bankruptcy because of the nature of bankruptcy data. Since bankruptcy occurs infrequently, forecasters use samples that span several years to estimate their models. The characteristics of most firms change from year to year. However, static models can only consider one set of explanatory variables for each firm. Researchers who apply static models to bankruptcy have to select when to observe each firm's characteristics. Most forecasters choose to observe each bankrupt firm's data in the year before bankruptcy. They ignore data on healthy firms that eventually go bankrupt. By choosing when to observe each firm's characteristics arbitrarily, forecasters who use static models introduce an unnecessary selection bias into their estimates. Hazard models resolve the problems of static models by explicitly accounting for time. The dependent variable in a hazard model is the time spent by a firm in the healthy group. When firms leave the healthy group for some reason other than bankruptcy, they are considered censored, or no longer observed. Static models simply consider such firms healthy.},

Spearman-rank correlation test was used for data analysis. Among the components of the weather, only temperature average (Â°C) was significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic (r = 0.392; p < .01). The finding serves as an input to reduce the incidence rate of covid-19 in Indonesia.},

abstract = {This study empirically examined the impact of financing innovation on technological innovation efficiency of select internet companies, that were affiliated with China between 2008 and 2017. Analysis was based on their patent and annual report data and used multiple input-output SFA model, system GMM, and panel fixed-effect model. The results are as follows. (1) There is significant variation in overall technological innovation efficiency of listed companies in the internet industry, and there is a downward trend. The technological innovation efficiency of business that use financing innovation methods is higher than those that do not. (2) The number of patents and intangible capital investment of internet businesses increase obviously every year, but there is no corresponding increase in the efficiency of technological innovation, and little intangible capital investment of non-financing innovation businesses. Thus, determining how to effectively improve the overall quality of patents and the efficiency of intangible capital investment is essential to improve the efficiency of technological innovation for Chinese internet businesses. (3) There is a term mismatch in the investment and financing of internet businesses in China. The financing structure between the financing innovation and non-financing innovation businesses has different impacts on the efficiency of technological innovation. And nowadays, more financing channels are short-term debt financing channels which invest in projects to improve the efficiency of technological innovation due to the pressure of debt repayment and the need to protect shareholders' interests. (4) In the panel regression, the coefficients of Icd and Roa are significantly negative, suggesting that the investment efficiency of internet businesses needs to be improved.},

abstract = {The emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), demonstrated that fecally contaminated liquid droplets are a potential vehicle for the spread of a respiratory virus to large numbers of people. To assess potential risks from this pathway, there is a need for surrogates for SARS coronavirus to provide representative data on viral survival in contaminated water. This study evaluated survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV). These viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25 Â°C, time required for 99% reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. In pasteurized settled sewage, times for 99% reduction were 9 days for TGEV and 7 days for MHV. At 4 Â°C, there was <1 log10 infectivity decrease for both viruses after four weeks. Coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {O sistema capitalista moderno demonstrou, apesar de suas transforma{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es institucionais ao longo da hist{\'{o}}ria, que as crises financeiras se tornam regressas nas economias. Assim sendo, se demandam teorias que superem o vazio do arcabou{\c{c}}o neocl{\'{a}}ssico quanto {\`{a}} explica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o destes colapsos, ao passo que {\'{e}} necess{\'{a}}ria a aproxima{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos fatos econ{\^{o}}micos {\`{a}}s explana{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es formuladas na academia. Torna-se importante, no mesmo sentido, definir como o agente p{\'{u}}blico pode contribuir para a estabiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da economia em crise e alcance os objetivos de pleno emprego. O objetivo deste ensaio te{\'{o}}rico {\'{e}} apresentar os pressupostos do autor p{\'{o}}s-keynesiano Hyman P. Minsky, no que se refere a sua Hip{\'{o}}tese da Instabilidade Financeira, congregando suas contribui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es quanto ao papel que atribui ao Estado. A hip{\'{o}}tese de Minsky, {\'{e}} que as crises s{\~{a}}o inerentes {\`{a}}s economias, que s{\~{a}}o compostas de complexas rela{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es financeiras entre os agentes. Isto porque, para financiar os investimentos, utiliza-se do sistema banc{\'{a}}rio em grande medida para compra de ativos para produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, os quais s{\~{a}}o financiados gerando d{\'{i}}vidas que ser{\~{a}}o pagas com o fluxo de caixa. Assim, o cumprimento destas obriga{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es depende da valida{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos lucros das empresas, ao passo que disponibilidade em emprestar por parte dos bancos (que n{\~{a}}o s{\~{a}}o apenas intermedi{\'{a}}rios financeiros, mas sim caracterizam-se em agentes especulativos em busca de lucros), depende ent{\~{a}}o da expectativa quanto ao ambiente econ{\^{o}}mico para que este fluxo de dinheiro das firmas retorne. Comp{\~{o}}em-se assim as tr{\^{e}}s rela{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de d{\'{i}}vidas: hedge, especulativa e Ponzi. Uma firma que esteja enquadrada na rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o hedge, consegue cumprir todas as suas obriga{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es ao longo do tempo, sendo seu fluxo de caixa robusto. J{\'{a}} uma unidade especulativa, em determinado momento pode conseguir pagar somente os juros e n{\~{a}}o o capital emprestado. J{\'{a}} uma unidade Ponzi, n{\~{a}}o possui fluxo de caixa suficiente para pagar nem o principal ou mesmo os juros, tendo ent{\~{a}}o que recorrer a novos empr{\'{e}}stimos ou efetuar a venda de ativos para cumprir suas obriga{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es. Ocorre que em {\'{e}}pocas de crescimento econ{\^{o}}mico, as expectativas s{\~{a}}o melhores e o financiamento {\'{e}} facilitado, no entanto, quando as condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es pioram, al{\'{e}}m do encurtamento dos meios de financiamento, h{\'{a}} uma modifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de empresas do tipo hedge, para especulativas ou mesmo para Ponzi. A fragilidade das economias depende do peso das posi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es financeiras dos agentes, sendo que quanto maior o peso de unidades Ponzi, mais fragilizado estar{\'{a}}, ao passo que a mudan{\c{c}}a gradual das condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es representa uma instabilidade intr{\'{i}}nseca, end{\'{o}}gena, parte integrante da din{\^{a}}mica interna do sistema e geradora das crises.

abstract = {Thus far, most of the work towards the construction of an evolutionary economic geography has drawn upon a particular version of evolutionary economics, namely the Nelson-Winter framework, which blends Darwinian concepts and metaphors (especially variety, selection, novelty and inheritance) and elements of a behavioural theory of the firm. Much less attention has been directed to an alternative conception based on complexity theory, yet in recent years complexity theory has increasingly been concerned with the general attributes of evolutionary natural and social systems. In this article we explore the idea of the economic landscape as a complex adaptive system. We identify several key notions of what is being called the new complexity economics, and examine whether and in what ways these can be used to help inform an evolutionary perspective for understanding the uneven development and adaptive transformation of the economic landscape. {\textcopyright} The Author (2007).

abstract = {Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P&lt;0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNAFunding StatementSupported by Ministry of Science and Technology, National Health Commission, National Natural Science Foundation, Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Abstract This paper presents the results of an opinion poll conducted in Brazil on the perception of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was prepared on Goo-gle Forms, disseminated through social networks, with questions about the socioeconomic profile and factors associated with isolation. A non-prob-abilistic sample was obtained with 16,440 respondents. Data were analyzed using the Stata 13 software. Social interaction was the most affected aspect among people with higher education and income (45.8%), and financial problems caused a more significant impact (35%) among people with low income and education. Those who practice some physical activity showed lower levels of stress 13%, as well as greater normality in sleep 50.3%. People who reported living in worse hab-itability conditions reported willingness to remain isolated for less time, 73.9%. Among non-isolated people (10.7% of the total sample), 75.8% believe that social isolation will reduce the number of victims of COVID-19. We conclude, based on this sample, that the perception about social isolation as a pandemic mitigation action varies by income, education, age, and gender. However, most believe that it is the most appropriate control measure and are willing to wait as long as necessary to contribute to the fight against COVID-19.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Innovation includes the introduction of new products or services and the upgrade of existing ones, which is of particular relevance for these economies. The results obtained using alternative measures of financial constraints and market competition, within a range of econometric techniques, suggesting a positive relation between public subsidies and the innovative activities of 11,998 firms across 30 Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries. This correlation is stronger for firms more likely to be financially constrained.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The sample period includes a severe recession with significantly higher-than-average default rates in the early 1990s. The results suggest a significant relationship between corporate sector default rates and key macroeconomic factors including GDP, interest rates and corporate indebtedness. The estimated model is employed to analyse corporate credit risks conditional on current macroeconomic conditions. Furthermore, the paper presents some examples of applying the model to macro stress testing, ie analysing the effects of various adverse macroeconomic events on the banks' credit risks stemming from the corporate sector. The results of the stress tests suggest that Finnish corporate sector credit risks are fairly limited in the current macroeconomic environment.},

Starting from Chick's stages-of-banking-development framework, we examine the experience of the FSU economies in transition from central planning. We then develop a five- phase framework to characterize the process of banking development required for them to reach stage two of Chick's framework, where bank liabilities are accepted as money.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the magnitude of social determinants in areas of risk of mortality due to tuberculosis in a high incidence city. Method: Ecological study, which recruited the cases of tuberculosis deaths registered between 2006 and 2016 in the capital of Mato Grosso-Brazil. The social determinants were obtained from the Human Development Units. Sweep statistics were used to identify areas of risk of mortality due to tuberculosis. Principal component analysis was carried out to identify dimensions of social determinants. Multiple logistic regression was applied to verify associations between the dimensions of social determinants and the risk of mortality from tuberculosis. A 5% error was fixed. The standard error was established at 5% for all statistical tests. Results: A total of 225 deaths due to tuberculosis were registered in the period, distributed heterogeneously in the space. A cluster of risk for tuberculosis mortality was identified, with RR = 2.09 (95%CI: 1.48-2.94; p = 0.04). Social determinants, low educational level and poverty were associated with the risk of mortality due to tuberculosis (OR: 2.92; 95%CI: 1.17-7.28). Income had a negative association with the risk of mortality due to tuberculosis (OR: 0.05; 95%CI: 0.00-0.70). The value of the ROC curve of the model was 92.1%. Conclusions: The results confirmed that the risk of mortality due to tuberculosis is a problem associated with social determinants. Health policies and social protection programmes can collaborate to address this problem.},

@article{Piatkowski2020,
abstract = {The need to pay some attention to the issues of investment processes undertaken in enterprises and explore this topic is a direct result of the important role that enterprises play in the economyâwith particular emphasis on the SMEs. From the company's point of view, it is crucial to obtain economic effects as a result of the implemented investment. The aim of the study was to analyze the results of tangible investments in enterprises in Ma{\l}opolska province in Poland, in two groups of entitiesâthose that implemented investments using EU subsidies and those that financed investments from other sources without using EU aid. This is a unique research in the field of analysis and presentation of investment data in enterprises, especially in relation to companies using EU funds. There is no comparative assessment of investments in enterprises on this topic in the scientific literature (concerning EU subsidies). For this reason, comparing the effects of investment activities between the two groups of enterprises studiedâusing and not using EU subsidiesâfills the research gap in this regard. The study was based on the critical analysis of domestic and foreign literature, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results of a survey among 160 enterprises using the CSAQ method, additionally extended by interviews with selected respondents. Data presentation uses a descriptive approach in combination with statistical analysis. A multiple linear regression model (MLR) was also used to verify hypotheses. Research results show that undertaking investment activities contributes to obtaining favorable results in enterprises, regardless of the source of investment financing. The source of financing the investment is not important for the results achieved in the enterprise. However, representatives of companies who received EU subsidies assess their market position higher after investment relative to companies that used other sources of financing for this purpose. Entities that have received EU subsidies have a stronger perception of investment as an important factor determining the company's development. In addition, variables were identified using the MLR model that affect the assessment of the financial position of enterprises in both groups of entities. This article supplements the knowledge on the economic effects of investments implemented by enterprises in the SME sector in Poland in a situation where these entities used and did not benefit from EU subsidies during 2007â2015.},

Policy is defined broadly to include diverse instruments (e.g., eco-labels, voluntary agreements, emission credits, and taxes), developed, administered, and promoted by state and non-state actors (e.g., cities, states, corporations, business associations, and non-governmental organizations) that are relevant to climate change. By disaggregating policy designs, we are better able to understand the features of policies (e.g., instrument type, regulatory target, built-in flexibility) associated with effectiveness and the trade offs different features create among evaluation criteria. Our analysis, thus, sheds new light on the final and arguably most important criterion of policy innovations - the extent to which they have lasting consequences.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess hospital services utilization in Brazil incorporating information about health services delivery. Methods: Data from the National Household Survey carried out by Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography (IBGE) in 1998 and from other sources were collected. Hierarchical models having the individual in the first level and the state of residence in the second level were used. Two models were separately adjusted for adults and children: logistic regression was used when to have been or not admitted was the response variable, and Poisson's regression was used when the number of admissions was the response variable. This last model was adjusted only for those individuals who had been admitted at least once. Results: The main determinant of hospital admissions was health need. Poor people were more likely to be admitted when controlling for health needs and enabling factors (health insurance coverage and regular health service). Only 1 to 3% of the variability in hospital admission utilization could be attributed to differences in services delivery at the state level. In the logistic models, the number of beds was positively associated and the number of doctors was negatively associated with the likelihood of admission. Poisson's models did not show any delivery variables associated with the likelihood of admission. Conclusions: These results suggest a delivery-induced demand impact concerning hospital beds. The inverse association of the number of doctors and hospital admissions suggests the impact of outpatient care on hospital utilization.},

abstract = {On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Innovation System research, this paper presents an extensive literature review on this large field of innovation research. Building on an analytical basis of the commonalities âsystemâ and âinnovationâ, the authors analyze the four main Innovation System approaches: National Innovation Systems (NIS), Regional Innovation Systems (RIS), Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis is structured systematically along ten comprehensive criteria. Starting with the founder(s) of each theory and the research program within each Innovation System approach was developed (1), the basic thoughts of each Innovation System approach are explained (2). For five case studies most cited (3), spatial boundaries are examined (4) and units of analyses are derived (5). By comparing the underlying theoretical concept and empirical results, the authors show patterns in the evolution of Innovation System research overall. By studying the basic components (6) and a functional analysis (7), each Innovation System approach is broken down into structural pieces and functional processes. If available, the authors present one or several taxonomies (8) for each Innovation System approach and summarize similar approaches (9), in order to classify and integrate the approaches into the ongoing innovation research. The identification of further research (10) shows which steps will need to be taken in the next years in order to evolve Innovation System research further and deeper. After the conclusion, the extensive table of comparison is presented which can serve as a guideline for academics and practitioners from basic and applied science, industry or policy that need to understand which Innovation System approach may be best for their specific analytical purposes.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature has concluded that financial liberalisation, in terms of the increased weight and influence of the financial sector, has contributed in a significant way to increasing disparities in income, wealth and society since the 1980s within advanced and emerging economies. Against a backdrop of financialisation, extreme inequality and evolving financial instability, this paper's primary contribution is to analyse the determinants of personal income inequality within one of the world's prominent emerging economies, Brazil. We pay particular attention to the magnitude, significance and scale of the determinants in a financialisation context, from which this paper's relative contributions emerge. Our empirical strategy utilises modern panel data techniques and different instrumental variables approaches for robustness. This paper's analysis provides a first step in the direction of identifying the main mechanisms through which the Brazilian model of financial liberalisation has affected income inequality at the sub-national scale; while providing an early indication of how inequality might evolve in the future. In conclusion, the revealed significant linkages between financialisation, local liquidity preferences, capital account liberalisation and social protection expenditure threaten more extreme inequality, both in Brazil's financial centre-space and beyond.},

If in the first period of transition the causes of nonperforming loans were mainly in the inefficiency of state owned banks and enterprises, now the attention is more focused on the micro and macroeconomic environmental factors where banks operate. This study tends to assess determinants of nonperforming loans in Albania. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the nonperforming loans in the Albanian banking system and in the same time the relation that exists between macroeconomic situation and nonperforming loans. Our main objective of this paper is to give our recommendations of what actions should banks take to reduce the non performing loans. Some of other objectives are: to analyze the present situation, to define the factors that influence in the performance of loans, to determine how affect the macroeconomic situation in nonperforming loans.},

Using matched employerâ employee data for the whole Swedish workforce, we determine how unrelated and therefore how novel the activities of different establishments are to a region's industry mix. Upâ and downsizing establishments cause large shifts in the local industry structure, but these shifts only occasionally require an expansion of local capabilities because the new activities are often related to existing local activities. Indeed, these incumbents tend to align their production with the local economy, deepening the region's specialization. In contrast, structural change mostly originates via new establishments, especially those with nonâlocal roots. Moreover, although entrepreneurs start businesses more often in activities unrelated to the existing regional economy, new establishments founded by existing firms survive in such activities more often, inducing longerâlasting changes in the region.},

The model is solved both numerically and analytically, by means of a stochastic approximation that is able to replicate quite well the numerical solution.

abstract = {An enterprise's propensity to innovate has been recognised to have an important bearing on its performance. In Kenya empirical work on micro and small enterprises (MSEs) propensity to innovate is still nascent in spite of the pivotal role played by these enterprises in the economy. The current paper used a Probit econometric model to analyse factors that influence MSE's decision to innovate or not. Results from the analysis show that the average number of years of education for a production worker, physical capital intensity, age of an MSE, access to finance and size of an MSE are important factors influencing MSEs innovation decisions. Higher foreign ownership and manager's experience were found to act as hindrances towards MSEs' decision to innovate. Based on the study findings it is clear that human capital skills and an MSE's resource endowment positively influences MSEs innovativeness.From a theoretical perspective, there is need for skills segmentation to isolate human capital skills that are most relevant for stimulating MSEs innovative activities. Firm level and policy level strategies are also needed to improve the technical skills of the average MSEs' production workers across the country. Subsidisation of physical capital and financial services for MSEs should also be used to promote these enterprises innovativeness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Green technology innovation is regarded as an important means to achieve sustainable development. Countries all over the world mainly implement green technology innovation policies from the aspects of environmental regulation and financing constraints. The effect of financing constraint policy on enterprise green technology innovation remains to be investigated. Based on the event of âgreen credit guidelinesâ issued by China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012, this paper collects the panel data of China's 2825 listed companies from 2007 to 2018, constructs a difference-in-difference model, and studies the impact of green credit guidelines on corporate green technology innovation and its mechanism. The empirical results show: First, green credit guidelines can promote corporate green technology innovation on the whole. Second, the mechanism of green credit on enterprise green technology innovation is identified. Green credit guidelines mainly limited green technology innovation through reducing debt financing, rather than through financing constraints. Third, the impact of green credit guidelines on green technology innovation is heterogeneous. Green credit guidelines have a significant effect on the green technology innovation of state-owned and large enterprises, but have no effect on the green technology innovation of non-state-owned and small ones.},

abstract = {Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17â45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34â58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24â65% (and peak deaths 15â69%), compared to 2â9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9â18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.},

The paradox of debt challenges the very foundation of Minsky's FIH as it sustains that upward and downward phases of the business cycles need not be characterized by processes of respective leveraging and deleveraging. Using a panel of firm-level data and seemingly unrelated regressions we analyze the relationship between debt and investment for twelve Latin American countries for the years 2005 (expansion) and 2009 (contraction). We reject the Paradox of Debt in favor of the FIH, regardless of our model specification or the choice of external financing. The FIH seems to intensify in expansions with respect to recessions, and its intensification during expansions is explained by a larger fraction of firms acquiring debt and new investment projects, rather than from further leveraging for those firms already engaged in fixed investment.},

abstract = {Innovation is widely recognized as a key factor in the competitiveness of nations and firms. Also, it has played a significant role in business ecosystem, and the achievement of science and technology have greatly spread to the development of both local and global firms. However, there are factors that discourage the applicable capabilities of such innovations on business processes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degrees of barriers which block the use of innovation in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam namely human resources, access to finance, transparency, tax rates, trade regulations and customs. The secondary data used were gathered from Enterprise survey (ES) of 479 small and medium enterprises in five different regions (Red River Delta, North Central Coast, Central Coast Area, South East and Mekong River Delta), which are conducted by the World Bank Group from 2015 to 2017. The binary logistic regression and Logit Model were used to process variables and data analysis. The major findings revealed that barriers of accessing financial capacity, trading regulations and customs have positively affected on innovation of SMEs in Vietnam. Finally, it could be emphasized that HR training has the strongest impact on innovation changes of the enterprises by 55.7%.},

The great advantage of R is that it is free, extremely flexible and extensible. The book addresses the specific needs of economists, and helps them move up the R learning curve. It covers some mathematical topics such as, graphing the Cobb-Douglas function, using R to study the Solow growth model, in addition to statistical topics, from drawing statistical graphs to doing linear and logistic regression. It uses data that can be downloaded from the internet, and which is also available in different R packages. With some treatment of basic econometrics, the book discusses quantitative economics broadly and simply, looking at models in the light of data. Students of economics or economists keen to learn how to use R would find this book very useful.},

Using matched employerâ employee data for the whole Swedish workforce, we determine how unrelated and therefore how novel the activities of different establishments are to a region's industry mix. Upâ and downsizing establishments cause large shifts in the local industry structure, but these shifts only occasionally require an expansion of local capabilities because the new activities are often related to existing local activities. Indeed, these incumbents tend to align their production with the local economy, deepening the region's specialization. In contrast, structural change mostly originates via new establishments, especially those with nonâlocal roots. Moreover, although entrepreneurs start businesses more often in activities unrelated to the existing regional economy, new establishments founded by existing firms survive in such activities more often, inducing longerâlasting changes in the region.},

To do so, the study attempts to capture the nature of the causal relationship between the two variables by applying linear and nonlinear Granger-causality tests. Rather than Wagner's law, the empirical findings of the study provide supportive evidence for the Keynesian view, subject to the economically meaningful components of government expenditures considered. Overall, the empirical findings show that government expenditures on defense, economic affairs, education, health, housing and community amenities, and social protection positively affect output that comes out through fiscal multiplier and investment-accelerator mechanisms proposed by John Maynard Keynes.},

abstract = {This study examines the business networks and localization effects for new technology-based firms (NTBFs) in the context of innovation performance (the number of patents and product differentiation). In this regard, the study includes 28 variables. A survey was conducted in 2016 with 401 Swedish NTBFs that were small and young (the employment mean was 1.80 and the average age of each firm was 28.3Â months). The biggest category of NTBFs was knowledge-intensive high-technology services, followed by medium high-technology manufacturing, and high-technology manufacturing. Hypotheses on how business networks and localization are related to innovation performance were tested using principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. The results show that the primary significant factor for innovation performance regarding business networks and localization dimensions are professional network services, while industrial and regional areas also have a positive relationship on product differentiation. Our study also shows that innovation performance enhances firms' abilities to access external financing through professional network services (e.g., venture capital companies).},

abstract = {Objective To investigate methods and processes for timely, efficient and good quality peer review of research funding proposals in health. Methods A two-stage evidence synthesis: (1) a systematic map to describe the key characteristics of the evidence base, followed by (2) a systematic review of the studies stakeholders prioritised as relevant from the map on the effectiveness and efficiency of peer review âinnovations'. Standard processes included literature searching, duplicate inclusion criteria screening, study keyword coding, data extraction, critical appraisal and study synthesis. Results A total of 83 studies from 15 countries were included in the systematic map. The evidence base is diverse, investigating many aspects of the systems for, and processes of, peer review. The systematic review included eight studies from Australia, Canada, and the USA, evaluating a broad range of peer review innovations. These studies showed that simplifying the process by shortening proposal forms, using smaller reviewer panels, or expediting processes can speed up the review process and reduce costs, but this might come at the expense of peer review quality, a key aspect that has not been assessed. Virtual peer review using videoconferencing or teleconferencing appears promising for reducing costs by avoiding the need for reviewers to travel, but again any consequences for quality have not been adequately assessed. Conclusions There is increasing international research activity into the peer review of health research funding. The studies reviewed had methodological limitations and variable generalisability to research funders. Given these limitations it is not currently possible to recommend
immediate implementation of these innovations. However, many appear promising based on existing evidence, and could be adapted as necessary by funders and evaluated. Where feasible, experimental evaluation, including randomised controlled trials, should be conducted, evaluating impact on effectiveness, efficiency and quality.},

abstract = {There have been many studies that have analysed the impact of a set of indicators on the economic resilience of countries and regions, but none that focus on the effects of determinants on the resilience of employment and GDP. This paper is a preliminary attempt to fill that gap by providing new cross-country, as well as cross-regional, evidence of the different effects of determinants on resilience measured in terms of GDP and employment. The analytical part of this paper is based on an analysis of the resilience of employment and GDP of EU countries, as well as at the NUTS 2 regional level, within the context of the economic crisis that began in 2008. The main method used in this study is correlation analysis. The results show the existence of specific determinants for a different type of resilience at the country level (e.g. indicators of economic structure). The determinants connected with human capital show a strong positive relationship with regards to resilience both at the country and regional levels (especially in terms of growth of employment and product).},

@article{Koopman2010,
abstract = {In the aftermath of the financial crisis, banks in the U.S. and Europe have been subjected to a sequence of stress tests to measure system stability. Such tests are formulated in terms of adverse economic scenarios rather than in terms of systematic default rate increases. This suggests that macroeconomic conditions fully capture default stress. However, two additional explanations can be found in the literature for the occurrence of default clusters: autonomous default rate dynamics, also known as frailty, and industry-specific effects including contagion. We develop a new methodological framework to disentangle, quantify, and test these three competing explanations. Using U.S. default data we find that observed macro and financial market factors\naccount for only 30-60% of systematic default risk. Consequently, stress-testing frameworks that only control for observed macro conditions leave out a substantial share of systematic risk. The components not related to business-cycle dynamics (frailty) are particularly relevant before and during times of financial market turbulence. For example, we find clear systemic risk build-up over the period preceding the 2008 credit crisis.},

abstract = {Diarrhoeal diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Brazilian children. However, from 1992 to 2001 there was a significant decline in hospitalizations for acute diarrhoea in children below 1 year of age in Brazil. A significant improvement in child health was also observed in the state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), with a decrease in child mortality from 70 to 40 deaths per 1000. Using distributed lag analysis we analysed a number of factors possibly connected with decreased hospitalization in RN and found that hospitalization was correlated up to lag 3 with poverty (P < 0.001) and inflation (P < 0.001). Improvements in public health infrastructure such as better waste collection, presence of city water supply and increased sanitation, socio-economic variables such as education and literacy, and increased investment in health services were all important in reducing severe early childhood diarrhoeas and thus directly associated with the decrease in hospitalization. We also observed a positive seasonal correlation between rainfall and hospitalizations with an increased in rainfall impacting positively on hospitalization in all lags. The data suggests that increased buying power and reductions in poverty played a crucial role in reducing hospitalizations for acute diarrhoea in infants in RN. {\textcopyright} 2009 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

abstract = {Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18Â years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1â4. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5â7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptorâangiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)âas SARS-CoV.},

@article{Guney2017,
abstract = {Using data for 939 publicly listed firms from 17 European countries over the period from 2004 to 2013, we investigate the effect of used credit lines on R&D investments, controlling for other determinants of R&D investments, i.e., cash flows, cash holdings, sales growth, equity financing, and Tobin's Q. Our estimation results, based on the system-GMM method, show that used credit lines have a positive and significant impact on R&D investments. In addition, we find that this impact is more pronounced for small and young firms than for large and mature firms. These results show that firms use credit lines as part of their liquidity management tools for supporting their R&D investments. Finally, we provide evidence that European firms in bank-based countries increased their use of credit lines for financing their R&D investments during the financial crisis of 2007â2009, while the link between R&D investments and used credit lines became weaker during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010â2013.},

@article{Minsky1986,
abstract = {"Mr. Minsky long argued markets were crisis prone. His 'moment' has arrived." - The Wall Street Journal In his seminal work, Minsky presents his groundbreaking financial theory of investment, one that is startlingly relevant today. He explains why the American economy has experienced periods of debilitating inflation, rising unemployment, and marked slowdowns-and why the economy is now undergoing a credit crisis that he foresaw. Stabilizing an Unstable Economycovers: The natural inclination of complex, capitalist economies toward instability Booms and busts as unavoidable results of high-risk lending practices "Speculative finance" and its effect on investment and asset prices Government's role in bolstering consumption during times of high unemployment The need to increase Federal Reserve oversight of banks Henry Kaufman, president, Henry Kaufman & Company, Inc., places Minsky's prescient ideas in the context of today's financial markets and institutions in a fascinating new preface. Two of Minsky's colleagues, Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, Ph.D. and president, The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, and L. Randall Wray, Ph.D. and a senior scholar at the Institute, also weigh in on Minsky's present relevance in today's economic scene in a new introduction. A surge of interest in and respect for Hyman Minsky's ideas pervades Wall Street, as top economic thinkers and financial writers have started using the phrase "Minsky moment" to describe America's turbulent economy. There has never been a more appropriate time to read this classic of economic theory.},

The study aims to contribute to the literature by connecting these theories and provides the following main conclusions. First, the LTF incorporates aspects of the FIH, as the theories share several key elements, particularly the presence of fundamental uncertainty, the constraint of liquidity, and the necessity for governments to act as lenders of last resort. Second, the liquidity concept used in the LTF can be better comprehended with the use of Keynesian and post Keynesian literature on the topic. Third, the LTF aims to advance and update certain aspects of Minsky's theory, particularly with regard to the globalization of markets, power relations, and the interdependencies of the political economy of finance. The study concludes that the theories are more complementary than divergent and future studies should create an analytical framework that integrates the theories' most insightful aspects.},

Results: The total number of retrieved articles in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase in April 2020 was 594, and after removing 259 duplicate articles, 335 papers were screened by the experts. After this investigation, 50 articles, in addition to 12 webpages, were extensively reviewed for the results section. Public health strategies and responses can be divided into four main areas, including monitoring, public education, crowd controlling, and care facilities. Conclusion: According to the results of the management decisions of some governments on quarantining, social isolation, screening methods, and flight suspensions due to the severity and anonymity of COVID-19, it is highly assured that these strategies would be the most successful approaches to confront the present pandemic. Governments should put in place timely and strict measures to halt the spread and diminish its unintended deadly consequences.},

@article{Baker2020,
abstract = {Introduction With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of contracting disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work. This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month. Results Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.},

abstract = {Early action refers to activities undertaken prior to a regulatory program or generation of services prior to mitigation of impacts elsewhere. In U.S. environmental markets, early action could reduce lags in environmental performance, improve outcomes, and encourage innovation in mitigation approaches. Multiple tools have emerged for encouraging early action in environmental markets. Several tools have also been deployed in markets, providing valuable insight into their function. This paper presents a systematic review of early action tools and describes their use in wetland and stream mitigation, species and habitat banking, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water quality trading. It finds that incentives necessary to motivate sellers differ from those motivating buyers. The tool or approach best suited to encourage early action also varies as conditions change. Anecdotal evidence suggests the potential for benefits to accrue from early action, but additional data are needed to inform the use of specific tools.},

abstract = {Under the background of the initial completion of Chinese interest rate marketization process, this paper aims to test the actual impact of interest rate marketization on micro-enterprise research and development (R & D) investments financing. Based on the current situation, we put forward the assumption that Chinese enterprises are generally facing financing constraints in R & D investment. The interest rate marketization, which reduced government intervention in fund pricing, helps alleviate financing constraints, especially for non-state-owned enterprises. This paper focuses on the moderating effect of interest rate marketization on financing constraints and R & D investments. The interest rate marketization index is constructed from three indicators: interest rate determination ways, interest rate fluctuation restrictions, and real interest rate level. We use the Euler-equation investment model to test the financing constraints of R & D investment. Based on panel data of listed firms for 2007-2016, we find that R & D investment faces wide financing constraints, and interest rate marketization alleviates financing constraints. More specifically, financing constraints are more significant for non-state-owned firms than for state-owned enterprises, and the deepening marketization of interest rates can effectively alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for analyzing the impact of macroeconomic conditions on credit risk and dynamic capital structure choice. We begin by observing that when cash flows depend on current economic conditions, there will be a benefit for firms to adapt their default and financing policies to the position of the economy in the business cycle phase. We then demonstrate that this simple observation has a wide range of empirical implications for corporations. Notably, we show that our model can replicate observed debt levels and the countercyclicality of leverage ratios. We also demonstrate that it can reproduce the observed term structure of credit spreads and generate strictly positive credit spreads for debt contracts with very short maturities. Finally, we characterize the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the pace and size of capital structure changes, and debt capacity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to revisit the relationship between the British State and the banks in the light of the crisis. This requires a historical treatment of the evolving relationship between these parties in providing society's money and facilitating credit creation. We then focus on how the previously supportive relationship was changed decisively in 1971 and consider implications for the future. Rather than making banks increasingly like non-bank financial intermediaries, we argue for a renewed relationship of mutual trust and obligation between the banks and the state as a means of reducing the future incidence of crises. 1 We contribute this paper in the spirit of affection for Alain Parguez and appreciation for his unstinting efforts to inject more sense into money-macro theory and policy. This paper is the product of chains of thought which for both authors were given a distinct boost by presentations to the ISMEA Seminar which Alain hosted in Paris on June14-15, 1985.},

S{\~{a}}o examinados, atrav{\'{e}}s de um modelo te{\'{o}}rico simples, os incentivos econ{\^{o}}micos associados aos v{\'{a}}rios aspectos das leis de fal{\^{e}}ncias e a algumas caracter{\'{i}}sticas particulares da antiga lei brasileira. Depois dessa discuss{\~{a}}o te{\'{o}}rica, {\'{e}} avaliado, empiricamente, o est{\'{a}}gio pr{\'{e}}-reforma da Lei de Fal{\^{e}}ncias brasileira comparando-a com diversas regi{\~{o}}es do mundo. Como resultado, encontramos que a antiga Lei de Fal{\^{e}}ncias era extremamente ineficiente, at{\'{e}} mesmo quando comparada com regi{\~{o}}es de renda per capita mais baixa. Fazendo uso de modelos econom{\'{e}}tricos {\'{e}} poss{\'{i}}vel verificar que tal inefici{\^{e}}ncia trazia severas conseq{\"{u}}{\^{e}}ncias para o de-senvolvimento do mercado de cr{\'{e}}dito nacional. Finalmente, analisando os principais aspectos da reforma da Lei de Fal{\^{e}}ncias brasileira, conclu{\'{i}}mos que as mudan{\c{c}}as feitas no sistema legal poder{\~{a}}o trazer um desenvolvimento significativo do mercado de cr{\'{e}}dito, expandindo o volume e diminuindo as taxas de juros cobradas {\`{a}}s firmas, al{\'{e}}m de uma melhora na efici{\^{e}}ncia da economia. 1 INTRODU{\c{C}}{\~{A}}O A legisla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o falimentar tem um papel fundamental para o bom funcionamento do ambiente de neg{\'{o}}cios e, conseq{\"{u}}entemente, da economia como um todo.

Na aus{\^{e}}ncia de tal lei, credores t{\^{e}}m dois procedimentos legais {\`{a}} sua disposi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o: primeiro, para cr{\'{e}}ditos segurados, os credores podem tomar os ativos da firma que servem de colateral para seus empr{\'{e}}stimos; segundo, para cr{\'{e}}ditos n{\~{a}}o-segurados, credores podem ir {\`{a}} Justi{\c{c}}a pedir a venda dos ativos da firma a fim de reaverem seus direitos. Entretanto, esse procedimento gera problemas quando existem muitos credores e quando os ativos da firma devedora n{\~{a}}o cobrem suas obriga{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es contratuais. Nesse caso, cada credor, agindo de acordo com seu pr{\'{o}}prio interesse, tentar{\'{a}} recuperar seus direitos o mais r{\'{a}}pido poss{\'{i}}vel. Essa corrida desordenada pode levar a um desmantelamento ineficiente dos ativos da firma, interrompendo o seu funcionamento e, provavelmente, for{\c{c}}ando-a a fechar as portas, mesmo quando o melhor uso de seus ativos seria continuar operando. 1 Tal falta de * Vers{\~{a}}o preliminar.

Based on data of Chinese listed companies from 2003 to 2016, this study, firstly, compares the impact of government and private VC on enterprise innovation using Possion regression, and applies the ITCV method and Negative Binomial Regression for Robustness Examination, then, explores the relationship between their shareholding percentage and enterprise innovation with threshold test. The results show that: the performance of private VC is significantly positive and in line. With the increasing shareholding percentage of private VC, the innovation of invested enterprises increases. The overall performance of government VC, however, is not significant, and the shareholding percentage of government VC also has no significant impact on the innovation of invested companies. Additional testing revealed that a âthreshold effectâ however exists in the impact of the shareholding percentage of government VC on innovation: within a certain range, the higher the shareholding percentage, the more significant the impact on innovations becomes, but beyond that range, the percentage is inversely related to innovation.},

Due to low import prices, the number of wrong-hand drive vehicles skyrockets in emerging countries like Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. I identify the causal effect of wrong-hand drive vehicles on road safety employing a new âbackward versionâ of the synthetic control method. Sweden switched from left-hand to right-hand traffic in 1967. Before 1967, however, almost all Swedish vehicles were LHD for reasons of international trade and Swedish customer demand. I match on accident figures in the period after 1967, when both Sweden and other European countries drove on the right and used LHD vehicles. Results show that right-hand traffic decreased road fatality, injury and accident risk in Sweden by approximately 30%. An earlier switch would have saved more than 4000 lives between 1953 and 1966.},

A joint decision model of labor supply and retirement was estimated to control the selection bias in the wages that are used to calculate the income differential between retirees or not. The main result indicates that the retirement reduces the wages of older people, especially the less educated who are less likely to get into better occupations. Thus, the permanence of the retired in the labor market may be motivated to supplement the income and the postponement of retirement could improve the situation of the older men in the labor market},

abstract = {This paper examines the financing behaviour of research and development (R&D) investments in emerging markets. Drawing on institutional theory and using panel data of generalized methods of moment estimation for a sample of 302 firms from 20 countries during the period 2003â2015, we find that emerging market firms tend to use internal funds for financing R&D investments. Interesting results emerged when the sample was divided as alliance and non-alliance firms, and bank-based and market-based financial systems. The results show that R&D financing behaves differently for alliance and non-alliance firms. Alliance firms use both internal and external funds for R&D investments, while non-alliance firms do not use external funds. We also document that a country's financial system influences the choice of available sources of finance. Firms from countries that follow a bank-based financial system tend to rely on external funds while firms from countries that follow a market-based financial system depend more on internal funds for financing R&D investments. This study is important as it provides new evidence on financing R&D investments in emerging countries taking into account the institutional arguments of financing choices, and so should guide stakeholders about appropriate sources of R&D financing.},

@article{Vlieghe2001,
abstract = {The determinants of the aggregate corporate liquidation rate in the United Kingdom are estimated from a sample of quarterly data using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach which allows for non-stationarity of the variables. The paper investigates what the appropriate measures of indebtedness are, and examines whether the unprecedented spike in the corporate liquidation rate in the United Kingdom in 1992 caused a breakdown in the relationship between the variables. The debt-to-GDP ratio, the real interest rate, deviations of GDP from trend and real wages are found to be long-run determinants of the liquidation rate. The birth rate of new companies, an index of property prices and nominal interest rates have significant short-term effects. The estimated equation is robust to changes in the sample period. The rapidly increasing level of indebtedness in the late 1980s was the main determinant of the subsequent increase in the liquidation rate. The decrease in the liquidation rate after 1992 was primarily due to lower real interest rates, lower real wages and the cyclical recovery of GDP.},

Before the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Brazil, several measures have been implemented including the adjustment of legal framework to carry out isolation and quarantine. As the cases increased significantly, new measures, mainly to reduce mortality and severe cases, have also been implemented. Rapid and robust preparedness actions have been undertaken in Brazil while first cases have not yet been identified in Latin-American. The outcome of this early preparation should be analyzed in future studies.},

While mainstream theories imply either equalising regional capital flows, or else lower credit availability for peripheral regions due to market imperfections, Post-Keynesian theory of liquidity preference and financial structure imply the scope for greater credit volatility for peripheral regions, especially in downturns, contributing to real economic divergence. This latter account is assessed by means of an empirical analysis of patterns in bank credit over the business cycle among the Spanish regions and Eurozone countries.},

abstract = {This paper presents the family of the Keynes+Schumpeter (K+S, cf. Dosi et al, J Econ Dyn Control 34 1748â1767 2010, J Econ Dyn Control 37 1598â1625 2013, J Econ Dyn Control 52 166â189 2015) evolutionary agent-based models, which study the effects of a rich ensemble of innovation, industrial dynamics and macroeconomic policies on the long-term growth and short-run fluctuations of the economy. The K+S models embed the Schumpeterian growth paradigm into a complex system of imperfect coordination among heterogeneous interacting firms and banks, where Keynesian (demand-related) and Minskian (credit cycle) elements feed back into the meso and macro dynamics. The model is able to endogenously generate long-run growth together with business cycles and major crises. Moreover, it reproduces a long list of macroeconomic and microeconomic stylized facts. Here, we discuss a series of experiments on the role of policies affecting i) innovation, ii) industry dynamics, iii) demand and iv) income distribution. Our results suggest the presence of strong complementarities between Schumpeterian (technological) and Keynesian (demand-related) policies in ensuring that the economic system follows a path of sustained stable growth and employment.},

abstract = {The paper analyzes the determinants of new products innovation in the SMEs sector. The study focused on types of innovation funding and sources of innovation funding. Five-hundred and fifty (550) SME owners were randomly selected for the study. Information was sourced through the use of questionnaires. Tobit model was used for the analysis. Sales value of new products was used a proxy for new products innovation. The determinants were grouped into two types thus innovation expenditure and sources of innovation expenditure. Sources of innovation expenditure have significant influence on new products innovation. From the finding foreign capital, government tax credit, and subsidies had significantly influence on new products innovation. SMEs specific attributes such as patent and having overseas partners influence new product innovation.Policies and programs geared towards government tax credit, subsidies, patent rights and inflow of foreign capital into SME sector should be encouraged since they have the potential of promoting product innovation in the sector.

abstract = {The smallholder dairy farmer's performance and ability to improve productivity for increased incomes, is driven by their level of innovativeness. Knowledge on the nature, degree and frequency of innovations provide opportunities for supporting the competitive advantages of smallholder dairy farmers to sustainably break away from the poverty cycle. Little attention has been given to measuring the performance and drivers of innovation for improvement of smallholder dairying in Malawi. Without understanding innovation, it is difficult to make policies and provide targeted, impactful support to smallholder farmers. This study is based on a cross sectional survey of 193 smallholder farmers in Lilongwe and Blantyre milk shed areas of Malawi. Innovation indices were computed to measure the innovation performance and further analysed to determine the drivers and barriers of innovations. Four categories of innovations namely; feeding, breeding, market, and animal health innovations are presented. The innovation index for the smallholder farmers was less than half (0.37) which is relatively lower in comparison to developed industries. The key driver was access to credit along with training, access to information and networking. For efficient and sustainable management of innovations, clear policies should be put in place to ensure formal structures for supporting continuity of innovations through enhancements in social networking among the farmers and cost effective mechanisms for accessing quality inputs.},

In health, a classic example is the combination of the relative risk between treatments estimated in different studies. Throughout this article we present the logic of the process, some basic concepts, the definition of fixed effect model and random effects model, tests of heterogeneity, model selection techniques and possibilities to presenting the results of a meta-analysis. The appropriate description of methodologies for systematic review wouldn't be subject of scrutiny. Thus this article aims to describe and analyze the process of meta-analysis (interpretative and conclusive) in statistics.},

abstract = {Background: Water plays an important role in the transmission of many infectious diseases, which pose a great burden on global public health. However, the global distribution of these water-associated infectious diseases and underlying factors remain largely unexplored. Methods and Findings: Based on the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON), a global database including water-associated pathogens and diseases was developed. In this study, reported outbreak events associated with corresponding water-associated infectious diseases from 1991 to 2008 were extracted from the database. The location of each reported outbreak event was identified and geocoded into a GIS database. Also collected in the GIS database included geo-referenced socio-environmental information including population density (2000), annual accumulated temperature, surface water area, and average annual precipitation. Poisson models with Bayesian inference were developed to explore the association between these socio-environmental factors and distribution of the reported outbreak events. Based on model predictions a global relative risk map was generated. A total of 1,428 reported outbreak events were retrieved from the database. The analysis suggested that outbreaks of water-associated diseases are significantly correlated with socio-environmental factors. Population density is a significant risk factor for all categories of reported outbreaks of water-associated diseases; water-related diseases (e.g., vector-borne diseases) are associated with accumulated temperature; water-washed diseases (e.g., conjunctivitis) are inversely related to surface water area; both water-borne and water-related diseases are inversely related to average annual rainfall. Based on the model predictions, "hotspots" of risks for all categories of water-associated diseases were explored. Conclusions: At the global scale, water-associated infectious diseases are significantly correlated with socio-environmental factors, impacting all regions which are affected disproportionately by different categories of water-associated infectious diseases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Yang et al.},

@article{Keen2011,
abstract = {The failure of neoclassical models to warn of the economic crisis has led to some rare soul searching in a discipline not known for such introspection. The dominant reaction within the profession has been to admit the failure, but to argue that there is no need for a drastic revision of economic theory. I reject this comfortable conclusion, and argue instead that this crisis illustrates the point made beforehand by Robert Solow, that models in which macroeconomic pathologies are impossible are not adequate models of capitalism. Hicks's critique of his own IS-LM model also indicates that, though pathologies can be imposed on an IS-LM model, it is also inappropriate for macroeconomic analysis because of its false imposition of equilibrium conditions derived from Walras' Law. I then focus upon what I see as the key weakness in the neoclassical approach to macroeconomics which applies to both DSGE and IS-LM models: the false assumption that the money supply is exogenous. After outlining the alternative endogenous money perspective, I show that Walras' Law must be generalized for a credit economy to what I call the "Walras-Schumpeter-Minsky Law". The empirical data strongly supports this perspective, emphasizing the need for a "root and branch" reform of macroeconomics.},

Substantive innovation and strategic innovation in one region could affect innovation in another region. In addition, the direct effect and spatial spillover effect of innovation policy could significantly affect innovation; however, they exert a higher impact on substantive innovation. Considering different policy tools, we found that government subsidies exert a significant positive impact on substantive innovation and strategic innovation, whereas financial institution loans exert a significant negative impact on substantive innovation and strategic innovation. And for the impact range, the government subsidies are higher than that of financial institution loans. Furthermore, this study reveals the leading environmental factors affecting regional innovation and provide a policy basis to promote the construction of an innovation-oriented country. Copyright:},

Methods: This is an ecological study with data recovered from the 15th epidemiological week and the 19th one of the year 2020 using the MHDI and the COVID-19 incidence coefficient for each municipality as variables. The univariate spatial correlation and the bivariate one were analyzed using the TerraView and GeoDa softwares. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 has spatial dependence with moderate positive correlation and the formation of high-high clusters located in the metropolitan region of Fortaleza and municipalities in the north region. The lowest incidence was a low-low cluster in the south and west regions. There was a positive bivariate correlation between MHDI and the incidence of COVID-19 with the formation of a cluster in the metropolitan region of Fortaleza. Conclusion: The uneven mapping of COVID-19 and its relationship with MHDI in Cear{\'{a}} can contribute to actions to regional combat the pandemic.},

abstract = {Background The advent of COVID-19 worldwide has led to consequences for people's health, both physical and psychological, such as fear and anxiety. This is the case in Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. Given the heightened fear concerning COVID-19 in Italy., the present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Methods The sample comprised 250 Italian participants who were administered Italian versions of the FCV-19S, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Severity Measure for Specific Phobia-Adult (SMSP-A). Several psychometric tests were performed to investigate the validity and reliability of the test including confirmatory factor analysis. Results Analysis of the data showed satisfactory psychometric characteristics and confirmed the scale's unidimensional properties. The seven FCV-19S items had acceptable correlations with the test total (from .443 to .784). Furthermore, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from .684 to .897). The internal consistency was very good ($\alpha$ = .871). Construct validity for the FCV-19S was supported by significant and positive correlations with the HADS (r=.649) and SMSP-A (r=.703). Conclusions The Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale is valid and reliable in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general Italian population.},

abstract = {The vast amount of health data generated and stored around the world each day offers significant opportunities for advances such as the real-time tracking of diseases, predicting disease outbreaks, and developing health care that is truly personalized. However, capturing, analyzing, and sharing health data is difficult, expensive, and controversial. This article explores four central questions that policy makers should consider when developing public policy for the use of ``big data{''} in health care. We discuss what aspects of big data are most relevant for health care and present a taxonomy of data types and levels of access. We suggest that successful policies require clear objectives and provide examples, discuss barriers to achieving policy objectives based on a recent policy experiment in the United Kingdom, and propose levers that policy makers should consider using to advance data sharing. We argue that the case for data sharing can be won only by providing real-life examples of the ways in which it can improve health care.},

@article{Phd2012,
abstract = {This thesis presents a detailed flow-of-funds analysis of the Chinese economy since 1992. An original theoretical approach to endogenous money, investment and profits is developed alongside the empirical analysis. It is argued that standard modern macroeconomic theory, such as the New Keynesian monetary macroeconomics and neoclassical growth theory are unsuited to the analysis of a long-run disequilibrium credit-financed investment- driven growth path such as that which has taken place in China. Using an approach built on accounting foundations, rather than the optimis- ing behaviour of representative agents, an analysis of credit creation, investment and growth is presented inwhich firms' investment expenditures are the key fac- tor in determining the dynamic evolution of the system. Steindl's analysis of the âmaldistribution of profitsâ is updated and re-worked in the context of state con- trol over the âcartelisedâ firms' sector. It is argued that the credit-financed invest- ment expenditures of the state-owned sector play the decisive role in generating the aggregate demand which has driven high growth rates in China, while si- multaneously conditioning the outcomes in terms of profit generation,monetary expansion and the distribution of liquidity and leverage. The development of the theoretical analysis is informed by a detailed em- pirical examination of the processes of money creation, investment and profits over the last twenty years in China. The empirical approach follows the theoret- ical analysis in that it is also based around the flow-of-funds national accounting system, resulting in an integrated and coherent analytical structure in which all transactions are matched by equivalent and opposite transactions elsewhere in the system.},

@article{Dow1987,
abstract = {It is a fact that economic development does not proceed evenly among\nthe regions of Western economies. Yet uneven regional development\nwithin developed capitalist economies has aroused little interest\namong orthodox economists of both the mainstream and the Marxist\nschools of thought. It has been economists in the political economy\ntradition who have provided most insights, and it is in line with\nthis tradition that we will address here the specific question of\nthe role of money in uneven regional development. Within the political\neconomy tradition, there are two views on money which are conventionally\njuxtaposed: Keynesian monetary theory, with its emphasis on liquidity\npreference, on the one hand; and on the other, the neo-Marxian theory\nwith money as the vehicle for realizing surplus value and bankers\n\nas a sub-class struggling for a share of that surplus. Conventionally,\nthe former is interpreted as a theory of short-run disequilibrium,\nand the latter as a theory of long-run, historical development. It\nwould appear therefore that only the neo-Marxian theory could contribute\nto an explanation of persistent uneven regional development. But\nthe Post Keynesian interpretation of Keynesian monetary theory demonstrates\nits relevance to the long-run as a series of short-runs; as such,\nit can be combined with features of the neo-Marxian long-run theory\nto provide a fuller analysis of money and economic development. The\npurpose of this paper is to demonstrate, using this combined theoretical\napproach, that money and financial institutions play an active part\nin promoting uneyen regional development in capitalist countries.\n\nThe argument to be presented here is thus a particulae or partial\none, set within a much more general context.},

abstract = {Does China achieve the Porter effect which states a win-win development of economy and environment? Besides environmental regulations (ER), financing is a critical factor affecting corporate technological innovation (TI). This study develops an integrated model to empirically investigate the interrelationship between ER, financial constraints (FC), and TI. The model is tested to make use of the DriscollâKraay standard error estimation and various regression models, based on detailed Chinese listed ï¬rm-level data covering the period from 2011 to 2017. Our baseline results show that ER have produced a crowding out effect of R&D input and inhibited patent outputs; as a consequence, the âweakâ version of the Porter hypothesis is not underpinned in A-share stocks listed firms. Further tests indicate that FC have a mediating effect on the relationship between ER and TI. The moderating effect of FC between ER and TI is mixed. The effect of ER on TI is affected by the threshold effect of FCâthe lower FC can better support the innovation compensation effect or alleviate the crowding out effect of ER. Thus, our findings offer new ideas for supporting financing mechanism of environmental governance to stimulate R&D innovation of listed companies.},

abstract = {Research and development expenditure (R&D) generate innovation and contribute significantly to the economic development. Previous studies emphasized the role of public R&D to encourage the technological innovation in the private sector. However, the effect of global economic crisis with respect to the public and private R&D link has been somewhat neglected in the empirical literature. Based on system GMM estimation, we found that public R&D complements private R&D in pre and post economic crisis. However, the strength of their complementary association is found strong in pre-economic crisis. In sum, the results indicate that continuous support to public R&D in pre and post economic crisis accelerate the technological innovation in the private sector. This study implies that public support to R&D is a good strategy for an economy to confront economic crisis effectively by increasing the technological innovation in the private sector. For policy makers, it is suggested that care must be taken while investing in the R&D, the investment is to be based on the ratio between R&D expenditure to number of R&D workers.},

abstract = {The solution adopted in Basel II to deal with procyclicality of capital requirements (i.e. through the cycle ratings and long-run average estimates of default probabilities) implies a reduction in the risk- sensitivity that contradicts the original spirit of the new framework. In order to preserve risk-sensitivity and to dampen procyclicality at the same time, Pederzoli and Torricelli (2005) set up a model which relies on a business cycle forecast in the estimation of the default probability and provide an application for the US. The modelling approach hinges on a forward-looking definition of capital requirements, in anticipation of the business cycle with a possible smoothing effect on the business cycle turning points. The present paper checks the robustness of the approach for the Italian case, where alternative business cycles chronologies are used and ratings have to be approximated by exploiting default data provided by the Bank of Italy. Findings suggest that the comparison between the alternative chronologies is an important issue.},

abstract = {China has experienced an outstanding economic expansion during the past decades, however, literature on non-monetary metrics that reveal the status of China's regional economic development are still lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through analyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic complexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces' ECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic development and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of ECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare different measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with monetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the non-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have stronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate regressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other socioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better understanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary macroeconomic indicators.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to be to analyze the form of regulation implemented by the Brazilian state between 1990 and 2000 exposing the obstacles and stimulus to economic development. To achieve these goals, the work makes use of an analysis of changes in institutional forms defined from the theory of regulation. In the 1990s, it was observed that the country adopted neoliberal policies, highly compromising for economic performance. However, in the 2000s, this ideology begins to modify. The government began to retake its role as promoter of development, promoting new changes in institutional forms. The greater changes are observed in the labor market and social policies. Likewise, the monetary and financial management have been shown to be somewhat less restrictive. However, many improvements are still needed, especially the change in shape of the country's insertion in the international regime.},

abstract = {Agricultural technology innovation is key for improving productivity, sustainability, and resilience in food production and agriculture to contribute to public health. Using panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2003 to 2015, this study examines the impact of rural financial development on agricultural technology innovation from the perspective of rural financial scale and rural finance efficiency. Furthermore, it examines how the effects of rural financial development vary in regions with different levels of marketization and economic development. The empirical results show that the development of rural finance has a significant and positive effect on the level of agricultural technology innovation. Rural finance efficiency has a significantly positive effect on innovation in regions with a low degree of marketization, while the rural financial scale has a significantly positive effect on technological innovation in regions with a high degree of marketization. Further analysis showed that improving the level of agricultural technology innovation is conducive to rural economic development. This study provides new insights into the effects of rural financial development on sustainable agricultural development from the perspective of agricultural technology innovation.},

abstract = {This paper uses probit and ordered probit methods to examine the impact of banks' policies in terms of cost efficiency, capitalization, activity diversification, credit growth and profitability, on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector after controlling for the effects of firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic conditions. Using a data set with detailed information for more than 9 000 firms comprising the portfolios of the ten largest Tunisian banks, we show that banks which are cost inefficient, low capitalized, diversified and small, are more likely to have a low quality of loans portfolios. However, bank's profitability does not seem to offer an important contribution in explaining the loan quality evolution. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of taking into account firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic developments when assessing the loan quality of banks from a financial stability perspective.},

abstract = {This paper analyses several severe financial crises observed in the history of capitalism which led to a longer period of stagnation or low growth. Comparative case studies of the Great Depression, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the Japanese crisis of the 1990s and 2000s are presented. The following questions are asked: What triggered big financial crises? Which factors intensified financial crises? And most importantly, which factors prevented the return of prosperity for a long time? The main conclusion is that stagnation after big financial crises becomes likely when the balance sheets of economic units are not quickly cleaned, when the nominal wage anchor breaks, and when there is no big and longer growth stimulus by the state. Some tentative conclusions for the subprime financial crisis and the Great Recession are drawn.},

@book{Schumpeter1994,
abstract = {At the time of his death in 1950, Joseph Schumpeter was working on his monumantal History of Economic Analysis. Unprecedented in scope, the book was to provide a complete history of economic theory from Ancient Greece to the end of the second world war. A major contribution to the history of ideas as well as to economics, History of Economic Analysis rapidly gained a reputation as a unique and classic work. As well being an economist, Schumpeter was a gifted mathematician, historian, philosopher and psychologist and this is reflected in the multi-disciplinary nature of his great endeavour. Topics addressed include the techniques of economic analysis, contemporaneous developments in other sciences and the sociology of economics. This inclusiveness extends to the periods and individuals who figure in the book. As well as dealing with all of the major economists from Adam Smith to Maynard Keynes, the book considers the economic writings of Plato and Aristotle, of the Medieval Scholastics and of the major European economists. Throughout, Schumpeter perceived economics as a human science and this is reflected in a volume which is lucid and insightful throughout.},

abstract = {Random shocks may push households that are not identified as being indigent into poverty. While regional poverty profiles have been elaborated for Brazil, vulnerability to poverty, i.e. the risk of falling into poverty in the future, has gained little attention. Using the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD), we apply a multilevel framework to calculate vulnerability measures and map the prevalence of vulnerability. We identify states and regions in which fluctuations in income produce disproportionately high rates of vulnerability. Hence, this is the first contribution that can draw a comprehensive regional picture of vulnerability, including rural areas. When discussing the determinants of vulnerability, recent literature typically focuses on current and often endogenous conditions, such as institutions or recent policies. However, we take up the idea of long term path dependence and link up our findings to clearly exogenous regional characteristics like geographic, climatic and historic aspects that potentially drive vulnerability.},

abstract = {Bibliometric analysis is a popular and rigorous method for exploring and analyzing large volumes of scientific data. It enables us to unpack the evolutionary nuances of a specific field, while shedding light on the emerging areas in that field. Yet, its application in business research is relatively new, and in many instances, underdeveloped. Accordingly, we endeavor to present an overview of the bibliometric methodology, with a particular focus on its different techniques, while offering step-by-step guidelines that can be relied upon to rigorously perform bibliometric analysis with confidence. To this end, we also shed light on when and how bibliometric analysis should be used vis-{\`{a}}-vis other similar techniques such as meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews. As a whole, this paper should be a useful resource for gaining insights on the available techniques and procedures for carrying out studies using bibliometric analysis.},

@article{Dow2016,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to clarify the difference between the mainstream and Keynesian understandings of uncertainty which persists in spite of superficial similarities. It is argued that the difference stems from the mainstream habit of thinking in terms of a full-information benchmark, where uncertainty arises from incomplete information. Degrees of uncertainty (or ambiguity) refer to the quantifiable extent of incompleteness. In contrast, Keynesian uncertainty cannot, even in principle, be eliminated. By treating uncertain knowledge as the norm, Keynesian uncertainty theory analyses differing degrees of uncertainty in relation to grounds for belief and thus considers the cognitive role of institutions and conventions in influencing the degree of uncertainty. The paper offers a simple diagrammatic representation of these differences, and illustrates its use with different depictions of the crisis, its aftermath and the policy response appropriate to each understanding.},

@article{Ranjan2003,
abstract = {This paper explores an empirical approach to the analysis of commercial banks' nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the Indian context. The empirical analysis evaluates as to how banks' non-performing loans are influenced by three major sets of economic and financial factors, i.e., terms of credit, bank size induced risk preferences and macroeconomic shocks. The empirical results from panel regression models suggest that terms of credit variables have significant effect on the banks' non-performing loans in the presence of bank size induced risk preferences and macroeconomic shocks. Moreover, alternative measures of bank size could give rise to differential impact on bank's non-performing loans. In regard to terms of credit variables, changes in the cost of credit in terms of expectation of higher interest rate induce rise in NPAs. On the other hand, factors like horizon of maturity of credit, better credit culture, favorable macroeconomic and business conditions lead to lowering of NPAs. Business cycle may have differential implications adducing to differential response of borrowers and lenders.},

By utilising a global sample of 86 countries over the period 2002â2017 and applying several econometric techniques, we find that financial institutions and financial markets, as well as their sub-indices (financial depth, financial access and financial efficiency), have significantly positive impacts on economic complexity. Interestingly, financial institutions have a stronger effect than financial markets, and it is the same with financial efficiency over financial access and financial depth. Three subsamples comprising 28 low- and lower-middle-income countries, 22 upper-middle-income countries and 36 high-income countries are examined.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Cordoba2016,
abstract = {342 by Lindley and colleagues found that black Americans were more likely to report vaccine-related side effects and have negative opinions regarding the effectiveness and safety of vaccines than were white Americans [25]. Another study found that lack of information on the availability of vaccines among Latinos was a key reason that many forgo vaccination [30]. However, negative opinions about vaccination, mistrust of the health care system, and lack of information related to vaccination do not fully account for the large disparity in vaccination between marginalized racial/ethnic groups and whites [10, 31]. Indeed, social and structural barriers such as limited access to health care, high health care costs, lack of insurance, and language barriers have also been cited as major factors influencing vaccination uptake [10, 31-34]. A study conducted in disadvantaged neighborhoods in New York City found that individuals who reported not being connected to health or social services or government health insurance were less likely to be vaccinated but were willing to receive vaccination if it were available to them [32]. In fact, researchers found that more than 70% of disadvantaged minorities and hard-to-reach populations living in New York City-such as undocumented immigrants, substance users, sex workers, and homeless individuals-who had never been vaccinated against influenza were interested in being vaccinated [32]. Non-English-speakers, specifically Latinos, face language barriers in accessing health care [33] and report that only a few health care providers speak their native language [31]. As a result, Latinos are 23% less likely to see a physician and have 70% lower uptake of influenza vaccination compared with white non-Latino Americans [14]. Furthermore, the children of non-English-speaking Latino caregivers are less likely to be vaccinated against influenza, creating a public health challenge that extends across generations [35]. Differences in vaccination rates that are likely to persist across generations have also been demonstrated in a study by Uddin and colleagues, which showed that influenza vaccine uptake among university students whose parents had some college education or less were 5 times lower than the vaccine uptake among students whose parents had a some graduate school-level education [36]. These socioeconomic differences in vaccination persist across generations even among those who have attained a higher level of education than their parents and in university settings where health care is equally accessible to all students [36]. Furthermore, educational attainment highly correlates with socioeconomic status in the United States, and influenza vaccination has been shown to follow a clear social gradient. For example , high-income households (â¥$75,000) report vaccination coverage 1.24 times that of households with incomes below $10,000 [21]. In summary, these data provide evidence that inequitable access to health care services and vaccination among disadvantaged populations exists and must be addressed in order to ameliorate the burden of severe influenza illness. A growing interest in understanding how contextual factors influence health outcomes has led to a rise in studies examining neighborhood poverty and influenza. Indeed, studies of the 1918 influenza pandemic show that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations suffered greater rates of infection and deaths [37, 38]. This disparity still holds true figure 1.},

@article{Schreier2011,
abstract = {Lead users are found to come up with commercially attractive user innovations and have been shown to be a highly promising source of innovation for new product development tasks. According to lead-user theory, these users are defined as being ahead of an important market trend and experiencing high benefits from innovating. The present article extends lead-user theory by exploring the antecedents and consequences of consumers' lead userness in the course of three studies on extreme sports communities. Regarding antecedents, it uncovers that field-related variables (consumer knowledge and use experience) as well as field-independent personality variables (locus of control and innovativeness) help explain an individual's lead userness. These variables might therefore be used as a proxy to identify the rare species of lead users. With regard to consequences, it uncovers that lead users demonstrate innovative behavior not only by creating new product ideas but also by adopting new commercial products more heavily and faster than ordinary users. This highlights the idea that lead users might not only be valuable to idea-generation processes for radically new concepts; instead, they might also be relevant to more general issues in the marketing of new products.},

abstract = {What will be the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the competitiveness of China, United States, and Vietnam in the next 3, 5 or 10 years? Despite this kind of questions has a large societal impact and an extreme value for economic policy making, providing a scientific basis for economic predictability is still a very challenging problem. Recent results of a new branch - Economic Complexity - have set the basis for a framework to approach such a challenge and to provide new perspectives to cast economic prediction into the conceptual scheme of forecasting the evolution of a dynamical system as in the case of weather dynamics. We argue that a recently introduced non-monetary metrics for country competitiveness (fitness) allows for quantifying the hidden growth potential of countries by the means of the comparison of this measure for intangible assets with monetary figures, such as GDP per capita . This comparison defines the fitness-income plane where we observe that country dynamics presents strongly heterogeneous patterns of evolution. The flow in some zones is found to be laminar while in others a chaotic behavior is instead observed. These two regimes correspond to very different predictability features for the evolution of countries: in the former regime, we find strong predictable pattern while the latter scenario exhibits a very low predictability. In such a framework, regressions, the usual tool used in economics, are no more the appropriate strategy to deal with such a heterogeneous scenario and new concepts, borrowed from dynamical systems theory, are mandatory. We therefore propose a data - driven method - the selective predictability scheme-in which we adopt a strategy similar to the methods of analogues, firstly introduced by Lorenz, to assess future evolution of countries.},

Furthermore, this paper discusses the moderating effect of policy burdens and ownership on political connections and R & D investment. Based on the Euler equation model, this study used dynamic panel data from Chinese listed companies over the period 2006-2015 to test the hypothesis. The results show that the sustainability of R & D investments of enterprises are more likely to face the threat of financing constraints. However, political connections can help maintain the sustainability of R & D investment of enterprises, but this effect exists only at the local political level, and firms need to undertake a policy burden in return. Additionally, this effect is more effective in private enterprises than non-private enterprises.},

Abstract The different forms of literature review are based on tools that vary from the traditional bibliographic review (narrative review) to the use of mechanisms and methodologies used by researchers in the fields of health and education to describe the state of the art of a theme, called systematic bibliographic review. This article aims at presenting the process of reviewing literature as a useful tool to aid in the conduction of organizational studies, bringing to this scope literature review methodologies from other knowledge areas, such as, for example, the systematic bibliographic review. The study adopts methodology that discusses the integrative review method, which belongs to the systematic bibliographic review. The research results show that integrative review allows the researcher to approach the issue he wishes to appraise, presenting an overview of his scientific production in such a way he can acknowledge the evolution of the theme over time and, thus view possible research opportunities in organizational studies.},

abstract = {This book combines the human development approach and innovation economics in order to explore the effects that structural economic change has on human development. While economic diversification can provide valuable new social choices and capabilities, it also tends to lead to more complex decision processes and changes to the set of capabilities required by people to self-determine their future. Within this process of structural transformation, social networks are crucial for accessing information and social support, but networks can also be a root cause of exclusion and inequality reproduction. This implies the need to encourage innovation and economic diversification beyond production expansion, focusing on the promotion of human agency and social inclusion. This book provides such a modern perspective on development economics, emphasizing the role of social networks, economic diversity and entrepreneurship for social welfare. The author discusses how innovation, social networks, economic dynamics and human development are interlinked, and provides several practical examples of social and micro-entrepreneurship in contexts as diverse as Peruvian rural villages and Brazils urban areas. The interdisciplinary perspective put forward in this book illustrates theoretical and methodological methods of exploring the complexity of development in a practical and relevant way. It also provides useful information about structural factors which need to be considered by practitioners when designing pro-poor growth policies. Furthermore, the coverage of the core concepts of innovation, networks and development economics, enriched with multiple examples, makes it a valuable resource for scholars and advanced students of modern development economics.},

We explore this question by assessing the out-of-sample performance of leading indicators of banking system distress developed in previous work, also extended to incorporate explicitly property prices. We find that they are fairly successful in providing a signal for several banking systems currently in distress, including that of the United States. We also consider the complications that arise in calibrating the indicators as a result of cross-border exposures, so prominent in the current episode.},

abstract = {The recent financial crisis has triggered a major rethink of analytical approaches and policy towards financial stability. The crisis has encouraged a sharper focus on systemic risk, the inclusion of a financial sector in macroeconomic models, a shift from a microprudential to a macroprudential orientation in regulation and supervision, and questions about whether price stability is a sufficient criterion to guide monetary policy. In the process, it has led to a rediscovery of the macroeconomic roots of financial instability. This paper argues that this development is welcome but has not gone far enough. To substantiate this conclusion, the paper documents this analytical and policy journey before suggesting a way forward.

abstract = {Background : COVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus's dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. Methods : This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson's test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus's spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. Findings : Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0{\textperiodcentered}003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0{\textperiodcentered}012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0{\textperiodcentered}070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0{\textperiodcentered}006). Interpretation : Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.},

In an attempt to offer some potential policy choices towards the achievement of sustainable development, this paper shifts emphasis from the popularly discussed economic development and carbon emissions nexus. Instead, we examine the impact of the banking and financial system's activities on carbon emissions for a sample of 45 countries. These are comprised of developed, emerging, and developing countries between 1990 and 2017. To fill the gap in the literature, the nexus is examined in seven different phases. This study exposes robust and reliable empirical results with the use of Feasible General Least Squares, random effects with regards to the DurbinâWuâHausman test, and Difference General Method of Moments panel data estimation models. Our findings indicate that the increase of domestic credit to the private sector and commercial bank lending consistently contributes towards aggravated carbon emissions in all economic types. Additionally, increased deposit rates in developing economies, increased lending rates in developed economies, and increased deposit rates in emerging economies contribute towards the overall reduction of carbon emissions. The decrease in lending to high GHG emitting members of the private sector by financial institutions in all economies is recommended based on the results of this study.},

@article{Rees2020,
abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care. Methods We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community. Results We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies - four each within and outside China - with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.

abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the dynamics of financial regulation â mainly banking regulation â on an international level. It takes the 10th anniversary of the Global Financial Crises as an opportunity for this reflection. To do that, the first step is a conceptual analysis of banks, banking systems, risks, and regulation, pointing out that the swings on regulation have to be understood in a broader context, which takes into consideration the different stages of capitalism. Following that, the paper tries to assess the impacts of the GFC on banking regulation. That said, one can notice that regulation moves like a pendulum, swinging from a more pro-market framework to another in which the regulation imposes more barriers to the functioning of banks. Besides, the paper points out that, no matter from where you depart in terms of a more or less pro market regulation, competition among banks will pressure the regulatory framework, leading to a less regulated and more fragile environment.},

@article{Schroeder2009,
abstract = {Purpose â The purpose of this study is to investigate why âfinancial fragilityâ carries different definitions in the economic literature. This is a useful task as the detection of âfinancial fragilityâ depends, in part, upon how one defines it. According to Post Keynesian economists, financial fragility is a process that can culminate in financial instability (an event). For mainstream or New Keynesian economists, financial fragility has been traditionally defined as a state in which a shock can trigger instability. More recently, however, mainstream economists have recast their definition as a particular form of financial instability â an event. Each definition of financial fragility is intimately linked to the theoretical foundation upon which it rests. This carries important implications for the ability of policymakers to assess and manage the health of an economy. Design/methodology/approach â The different approaches to the definition and detection of financial fragility are compared using corresponding sets of indicators. Indicators for the Post Keynesian approach are derived from a simple cash-flow accounting framework, in the spirit of Hyman Minsky. The economy selected for study is New Zealand. Findings â According to the Post Keynesian approach, New Zealand has been in a financially fragile state for over three years, a period during which policymakers could have been creating ways to make New Zealand more resilient to the onset of instability. According to the New Keynesian approach, New Zealand may just now be experiencing fragility, giving policymakers much less time to react. Originality/value â This study traces the definitions of financial fragility to their underlying theoretical frameworks and draws the implications for the methods of detecting financial fragility.},

@article{Lara2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of knowledge, both tacit and codified, in the formation of the state of long-term expectations that drive firms' decisions to search for innovation and to investment in R&D. The paper takes the post-Keynesian theory as reference, associating it with the neo-Schumpeterian analysis of innovation dynamics. First, it is argued that knowledge plays a crucial role in building agents' confidence, emphasizing that radical innovations are more dependent on the accumulation of codified knowledge, given the higher degree of uncertainty associated with this type of innovation, while incremental innovations are more dependent on tacit knowledge about the current market conditions and technological trajectory. Second, it is argued that the accumulation of knowledge and the constant introduction of innovations foster the creation of a convention to innovate, which facilitates the decision to pursue innovations by influencing long-term expectations.},

abstract = {Aim of study: This paper determines the preferences for debt or equity â common stock and self-financing â that are shown by agri-food companies to finance innovation investment strategies and identify the monitoring role that third-party funding providers can play. Area of study: A sample of 41,109 Spanish SMEs (364,020 observations). Material and methods: The information was obtained from the SABI database, using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator and a logistic regression like contrast methodologies. Main results: Spanish agri-food companies undertake innovation projects by financing these investments through owners' resour-ces, mainly from current common stock, as they are independent of these companies' capacity to generate internal funds. This may be conditioned by the problems of severe negative self-financing presented by this sector in Spain which make it difficult to use retained earnings as a source of financing for new investments; 30% of these firms have a negative self-financing level of EUR 100,000 as the losses accumulated by economic activity are higher than the reserves provided. Research highlights: Agri-food companies prefer to use owners' funds to finance innovation projects which allows them to maintain the concentration of power, a decision that is reinforced by the limitation to credit access due to innovation creates intangible assets that are not usually accepted as collateral by financial institutions. Meanwhile, given the particularities of these companies â instability and liquidity problems due to the need for funds of operations â the recourse to debt is an appropriate control mechanism to prevent overinvestment decisions.},

abstract = {Solomon and Golo [1] have recently proposed an autocatalytic (self-reinforcing) feedback model which couples a macroscopic system parameter (the interest rate), a microscopic parameter that measures the distribution of the states of the individual agents (the number of firms in financial difficulty) and a peer-to-peer network effect (contagion across supply chain financing). In this model, each financial agent is characterized by its resilience to the interest rate. Above a certain rate the interest due on the firm's financial costs exceeds its earnings and the firm becomes susceptible to failure (ponzi). For the interest rate levels under a certain threshold level, the firm loans are smaller then its earnings and the firm becomes 'hedge.' In this paper, we fit the historical data (2002-2009) on interest rate data into our model, in order to predict the number of the ponzi firms. We compare the prediction with the data taken from a large panel of Italian firms over a period of 9 years. We then use trade credit linkages to discuss the connection between the ponzi density and the network percolation. We find that the 'top-down'-'bottom-up' positive feedback loop accounts for most of the Minsky crisis accelerator dynamics. The peer-to-peer ponzi companies contagion becomes significant only in the last stage of the crisis when the ponzi density is above a critical value. Moreover the ponzi contagion is limited only to the companies that were not dynamic enough to substitute their distressed clients with new ones. In this respect the data support a view in which the success of the economy depends on substituting the static 'supply-network' picture with an interacting dynamic agents one.},

Hazard models make use of the data on timing of these alternative outcomes and we exploit this to focus attention on how the hazards change over the business cycles, conditional on the post-listing age of the firm.

abstract = {New York City is the hot spot of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. This paper merges information on the number of tests and the number of infections at the New York City zip code level with demographic and socioeconomic information from the decennial census and the American Community Surveys. People residing in poor or immigrant neighbourhoods were less likely to be tested; but the likelihood that a test was positive was larger in those neighbourhoods, as well as in neighbourhoods with larger households or predominantly black populations. The rate of infection in the population depends on both the frequency of tests and on the fraction of positive tests among those tested. The non-randomness in testing across New York City neighbourhoods indicates that the observed correlation between the rate of infection and the socioeconomic characteristics of a community tells an incomplete story of how the pandemic evolved in a congested urban setting.},

@article{Minsky1996a,
abstract = {Remarks Upon Receiving the Veblen-Commons Award Hyman P. Minsky There seems to me to be no other economist with whose general way of thinking I feel myself in such genuine accord. âJohn Maynard Keynes in a letter to John R. Commons [Keynes 1927] The agents in the model have a model ofthe model. âPeter Alhin [Statement at a Jerome Levy Conference] The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and imcertainty. We take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be imsure-that it is possible to live and not know. âRichard Feynman [Gleick 1992, 171] Keynes's letter to John R. Commons illustrates the affinity between the econom- ics of Keynes and the American institutionalists. This affinity is as relevant now as it was when Keynes wrote to Commons. The current crisis of performance and con- fidence in the rich capitalist countries makes it necessary, once again, to think about the institutional prerequisites for successfiil capitalism. Keynes always stressed the importance of "vigilant observation" for success- ftil theory-construction, theory being nothing more, in his view, than a styl- ized representation of the dominant tendencies of the time, derived fTom reflection on the saUent facts [Skidelsky 1992, 221]. In this view, relevant theory is not a compendium of propositions derived from axioms assumed to be universally true: economic theory is not a subdivision of mathematics. Relevant theory is the result of the exercise of imagination and logical powers on observations that are due to experience: it yields propositions about the operation of an actual economy. The current methodological fashion, where artifi- cial economies are first specified, then simulated and finally deemed satisfactory (unsatisfactory) if it can be said that the general characteristics of the simulation are similar (dissimilar) to the general characteristics of a time series of constructs based upon observations (such as GNP), would most certainly have been anathema to both Keynes and to the institutionalists of his day [Montgomery 1994]. In today's termi- nology, Keynes's "behefs" are mental models that lead to propositions about the be- havior of the "real world" economy. This approach makes "real world" outcomes dependent upon institutions. It sanctions state interventions to create institutions that lead to an economy with desirable properties. The last act of Keynes's life was his deep involvement in the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Much earlier he proposed institutions that would create what today we might call "capitahsm with a human face," which obviously was the aim of the great insti- tutionalists.^ I propose to take up four topics: 1. The link between the position of Keynes, in A Treatise on Probability [1921], on the nature of inference in the creation of beliefs and the contem- porary view, as exemphfied by Thomas J. Sargent in Bounded Rationality in Macroeconomics [1993], about the models that enter into decisions once the boundedness of rationality is acknowledged. 2. Capitalism in the United States is now in a new stage, "money manager capi- talism, " in which the proximate owners of a vast proportion of financial in- struments are mutual and pension funds. The total return on the portfolio is the only criteria used for judging the performance of the managers of these funds, which translates into an emphasis upon the bottom line in the manage- ment of business organizations. It makes the long view a luxury that only companies that are essentially owned by a single individual and that are not deeply dependent upon external financing can afford. 3. Public tolerance for uncertainty is limited. The New Deal restructuring of capitalism created institutions that contained uncertainty. The evolution of the economy has decreased the effectiveness of the New Deal reforms, and money manger capitalism has radically increased uncertainty. The creation of new economic institutions that constrain the impact of uncertainty is neces- sary. 4. I conclude with some thoughts about measures that may constrain the insecu- rity bred by the attenuation of the effectiveness of the New Deal structures along with the heightened uncertainty due to money manager capitalism.},

While Minsky developed theoretical analyses of financial fragility for use in economic growth models, its empirical application is limited. Based on the financial fragility indices derived from a cash flow accounting framework and Minsky's margins of safety, I detect the overall configuration and evolution of financial fragility (hedge, speculative, and Ponzi) in Japan. Then, the factors that determine the probability of being Ponzi finance are detected by using panel logistic regression. In doing so, this study reveals that although speculative finance is dominant in many sectors, the evolution of financial fragility is diversified and its determinants differ according to sector and size in Japan.},

The sample comprised data for 75 developed and developing countries for the period 1996 to 2010. An inverted U-shaped non-linear relationship between finance and innovation was observed. This finding implies that finance enhances innovation only up to a certain level. Beyond that level, further development of finance tends to affect innovation adversely. The institution interaction term was included to examine its role in the relationship between finance and innovation. The results suggest that the finance-innovation curve varies with different settings of institutional quality. Specifically, the finance-innovation relationships followed an inverted U curve only for countries with high institutional quality. Hence, sound institutional quality is a prerequisite for financial development to benefit innovation.},

Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community-based approach. Health is the best element of cohesion for inserting development and progress proposals in indigenous communities, given the vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, all information is provided (as possible) on risk factors and potential solutions in indigenous communities in the hope of providing solutions to this pandemic and providing a reference for future studies.},

In the following discussion some understood that a solid regulation and a better supervision could control them, reducing potential systemic instability and the costs of bankruptcy, while others thought that they should be shrink and simplified. However, in the United States, the too big to fail bank's problem turned to be worse after the crisis, once rescue operations led to even bigger and more complex banks. After an analysis of the long-term movement of concentration in the US banking system and its intensification after the recent crisis, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the implications of measures under the Dodd-Frank Act, specifically focused on systemically important institutions. The hypothesis is that US banking system still has high propensity to generate fragility and instability episodes, in a Minskyan sense, in spite of the more intense regulatory pressure over the big banks.},

abstract = {<p>Using data from the WHO's Situation Report on the COVID-19 pandemic from 21 January 2020 to 30 March 2020 along with other health, demographic, and macroeconomic indicators from the WHO's Application Programming Interface and the World Bank's Development Indicators, this paper explores the death rates of infected persons and their possible associated factors. Through the panel analysis, we found consistent results that healthcare system conditions, particularly the number of hospital beds and medical staff, have played extremely important roles in reducing death rates of COVID-19 infected persons. In addition, both the mortality rates due to different non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and rate of people aged 65 and over were significantly related to the death rates. We also found that controlling international and domestic travelling by air along with increasingly popular anti-COVID-19 actions (i.e., quarantine and social distancing) would help reduce the death rates in all countries. We conducted tests for robustness and found that the Driscoll and Kraay (1998) method was the most suitable estimator with a finite sample, which helped confirm the robustness of our estimations. Based on the findings, we suggest that preparedness of healthcare systems for aged populations need more attentions from the public and politicians, regardless of income level, when facing COVID-19-like pandemics.</p>},

abstract = {Evidence on the "funding gap" for investment innovation is surveyed. The focus is on financial market reasons for underinvestment that exist even when externality-induced underinvestment is absent. We conclude that while small and new innovative firms experience high costs of capital that are only partly mitigated by the presence of venture capital, the evidence for high costs of R&D capital for large firms is mixed. Nevertheless, large established firms do appear to prefer internal funds for financing such investments and they manage their cash flow to ensure this. Evidence shows that there are limits to venture capital as a solution to the funding gap, especially in countries where public equity markets for VC exit are not highly developed. We conclude by suggesting areas for further research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding if credit risk is driven mostly by idiosyncratic firm characteristics or by systematic factors is an important issue for the assessment of financial stability. By exploring the links between credit risk and macroeconomic developments, we observe that in periods of economic growth there may be some tendency towards excessive risk-taking. Using an extensive dataset with detailed information for more than 30 000 firms, we show that default probabilities are influenced by several firm-specific characteristics. When time-effect controls or macroeconomic variables are also taken into account, the results improve substantially. Hence, though the firms' financial situation has a central role in explaining default probabilities, macroeconomic conditions are also very important when assessing default probabilities over time. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in more than 250 countries has become a serious threat to the health of people around the world. Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. Therefore, in this study, was discussed the role of environmental factors and conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed as well as food, water and sewage, air, insects, inanimate surfaces, and hands in COVID-19 transmission. The results of studies on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others. Temperature increase and sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on surfaces. When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 degrees C, the cumulative number of cases decreases by 0.86%. According to the latest evidence, the presence of coronavirus in the sewer has been confirmed, but there is no evidence that it is transmitted through sewage or contaminated drinking water. Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease. According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology. The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet. There have been no reports of SARS-COV-2 transmission by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes.},

abstract = {The aim of this piece is to analyze some territorial determinants to the total amount of credit in a specific region. These determinants are derived from the economics conditions of the region and are observed through the liquidity preference of banks and public. Accordingly to the Post Keynesian approach, less developed regions have a higher liquidity preference due to the higher uncertainty that prevails in that region. As a consequence, both the demand and the supply of credit would be shorter in less developed regions. To analyze this hypothesis, the liquidity preference of banks and public were calculated for all Brazilians states. The results founded, both on the descriptive and the econometric analysis, indicate that the hypotheses are correct, especially in relation to the bank's liquidity preference. The results also show the limits of the theoretical framework to study the Brazilian bank system, which is characterized by possessing profitability's strategies that are not based on the supply of credit.},

The ten most innovative cities in the United States account for 23% of the national population, but for 48% of its patents and 33% of its gross domestic product. But why has human activity become increasingly concentrated? Here we use data on scientific papers, patents, employment and gross domestic product, for 353 metropolitan areas in the United States, to show that the spatial concentration of productive activities increases with their complexity. Complex economic activities, such as biotechnology, neurobiology and semiconductors, concentrate disproportionately in a few large cities compared to less--complex activities, such as apparel or paper manufacturing. We use multiple proxies to measure the complexity of activities, finding that complexity explains from 40% to 80% of the variance in urban concentration of occupations, industries, scientific fields and technologies. Using historical patent data, we show that the spatial concentration of cutting-edge technologies has increased since 1850, suggesting a reinforcing cycle between the increase in the complexity of activities and urbanization. These findings suggest that the growth of spatial inequality may be connected to the increasing complexity of the economy.},

Identifying the main determinants of entrepreneurial activity is important for helping the decision makers in adopting adequate measures to support the creation and development of new businesses. The turbulent economic environment in recent years dominated by economic and financial crises, resulting in a reduction in economic growth but also in an increase in unemployment, has led decision makers to turn their attention again to the determinant factors of entrepreneurship. Starting from those stated above, through this paper we aim to investigate the impact of some macroeconomic, individual and business environment-related factors on the dynamics of entrepreneurial activity in 18 European Union (EU) countries for a period of 14 years (2002-2015). We use three regression models and we apply panel data fixed effect model approach. The results of our study highlight that inflation rate, foreign direct investments, access to finance and total tax rate are the main macroeconomic determinants of entrepreneurship. Also, we find that all individual business-related factors considered in the analysis have a significant impact on total entrepreneurship rate.},

Indicators were defined in four areas: academic plan, management policy, academic production, and relationship between university and society. The database of indicators was built according to the DevInfo technology used by the United Nations (UNDG-UN) to monitor the Millennium development goals (MDGs). This technology allows the inclusion of several monitoring frameworks, and the storage, retrieval, analysis, and dissemination of information (in the form of maps, graphs, and tables, both on-line and stand-alone) in a very user-friendly and flexible way, with indicators for different grouping levels (geographic and sub-populations) and time periods. The database, the development of which is still on-going, contains 80 indicators for three grouping levels (campus, center, and department) and four time periods (2008-2011), and consists of 3083 observational data.},

abstract = {Keynes's discussion of "the state of long-term expectation" explains why uncertainty about the future makes investment unstable. Minsky used Keynes's ideas to explain why every economic boom sets the stage for a financial crisis. This paper extends the Keynes/Minsky framework by arguing that uncertainty about the future also biases scientific knowledge and human culture. Just like overly optimistic financial markets, the persistence of inaccurate scientific paradigms and cultural beliefs can also generate financial crises. For example, the debt toward nature that our capitalist culture continues to obscure is likely to be a case of Ponzi finance. The Keynes/Minsky framework is useful for analyzing diverse causes of potential economic instability. {\textcopyright} 2012, Journal of Economic Issues/Association for Evolutionary Economics.},

It was studied some sector indicators over the years and estimated an econometric panel data model. It was observed that the residential construction output during this period is increasing exponentially, both in national and state levels. As determinants of this behavior, based on data collected for the years 2002-2007, it was identified that sector output is positively related to real income, unskilled labor and population growth, and negatively associated with sector prices and the spread between short and long term real interest rates.\n\nKeywords: Residential construction.

In this sense, it is proposed to rescue the contributions of Keynes, considering the specific treatment of the author to these agents, as well as the recovery of aspects of the monetary economy that must to be considered for understanding of the decisions of families, especially when considering transformations of the U.S. economy, the increasing financial integration of the families. However, it is considered that the Minskyan approach, to contemplate the dynamics of the financing and acquisition of assets, and the impacts of decisions over successive current periods, appears as a referential which allows to enhance the understanding and representation of the theoretical behavior of households, because allows us to consider these agents in a perspective of planning, beyond the short term and not limited to the spending on current consumption and income restrictions.},

abstract = {This article presents an analysis of macroeconomic factors and their impact on the percentage of nonÂ­performing loans (NPLs) in commercial banks of the EU countries. This problem is relevant because in reÂ­ cent years many EU countries had the economic downturns that can be visible in the main macroeconomic indicators. Also, banks have met the growth of nonÂ­performing loans when the debtors were not able to meet their financial obligations. The Basel III Agreement notes the necessity to consider the economic conditions of a country when assessing the credit risk of loan applicants. The results of this research can be useful for banks, because the main relations between macroeconomics and nonÂ­performing loans have been revealed. Since 2009, Lithuania has one of the highest NPL percentage in the EU, and the meaningful impact of economic deÂ­ terioration on the debtors' ability to repay debts to banks has been proven. The same situation was ascertained in other EU countries with imperfect economic conditions. Conversely, it has been estimated that banking sysÂ­ tems in the EU countries with developed economies are not very sensitive to the business cycle fluctuations. So, in Lithuanian banks, when managing credit risk, the consideration of economic conditions is very important.},

abstract = {For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

Se realiza una estimaci{\'{o}}n de la probabilidad de default (PD) de cada uno de los cr{\'{e}}ditos bancarios concedidos en el pa{\'{i}}s, y por primera vez se utiliza informaci{\'{o}}n con tanto nivel de detalle. El per{\'{i}}odo de an{\'{a}}lisis comprende un ciclo econ{\'{o}}mico completo (1999 a 2009) y 776.830 observaciones deudor-a{\~{n}}o. Se trabaja con estimaciones logit y con modelos para datos de panel con variable dependiente binaria. En el caso de las empresas, los factores asociados a una mayor PD son: la dolarizaci{\'{o}}n del cr{\'{e}}dito, el monto adeudado y la cantidad de defaults previos. Los factores asociados a una menor PD son el porcentaje cubierto por garant{\'{i}}as computables, la cantidad de instituciones en las que el deudor mantiene saldo y la duraci{\'{o}}n del cr{\'{e}}dito (mayor plazo, menor PD). Para el caso de las personas f{\'{i}}sicas, un aumento en la dolarizaci{\'{o}}n del cr{\'{e}}dito o en el monto adeudado est{\'{a}} vinculado con una mayor PD; mientras que el ingreso medio de los hogares, el porcentaje cubierto por garant{\'{i}}as computables, la cantidad de instituciones en la que la persona mantiene deudas est{\'{a}}n asociados a una menor PD del deudor. Nuestra estimaci{\'{o}}n preferida sugiere que la evoluci{\'{o}}n del PIB sectorial, y no las variables idiosincr{\'{a}}sicas de los deudores, parece ser el factor que m{\'{a}}s impacta en la PD. Si el PIB sectorial pasa de crecer al 3% a estancarse, entonces la PD de las empresas crecer{\'{i}}a en 10 puntos porcentuales (pasando de una PD promedio de 7% al 17%) y la de las familias en (al menos) 3 puntos porcentuales (duplic{\'{a}}ndose del 3% al 6%).

abstract = {Although credit risk is an important factor that financial institutions must cope with, the determinants of bank problem loans have been little studied. Using panel data, we compare the determinants of problem loans of Spanish commercial and savings banks in the period 1985ï¿½1997, taking into account both macroeconomic and individual bank level variables. The GDP growth rate, firms, and family indebtedness, rapid past credit or branch expansion, inefficiency, portfolio composition, size, net interest margin, capital ratio, and market power are variables that explain credit risk. However, there are significant differences between commercial and savings banks, which confirm the relevance of the institutional form in the management of credit risk. Our findings raise important bank supervisory policy issues: the use of bank level variables as early warning indicators, the advantages of bank mergers from different regions, and the role of banking competition and ownership in determining credit risk.},

The translation rigorously followed the criteria described by Herdman (1998), to maintain maximum functional equivalence. The adapted questionnaire was tested on 107 health care professionals from Belo Horizonte. Standard and Weighted Kappa tests were used to evaluate the reproducibility of the instrument. Most of the questions achieved Kappa test values above 80% (excellent). The Brazilian version of the questionnaire was, therefore, adapted and had proven reproducibility.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany Regional resilience is a new paradigm to explain the local system ability to cope with a negative event, tolerating the effect produced by the perturbing action. The first objective of the paper is to analyze the complex concept of regional resilience, adopting a systemic and holistic approach. Using a multidimensional methodology, regional resilience is described by outcome and driver variables, with focus on sustainability of local systems, broken down into the three pillars of economy, society and environment, whereby the holistic approach means that each dimension of territorial sustainable development is partly determined by its relations with the other dimensions. The second aim of the paper is then to test the relations between determinants and outcome of regional resilience. This framework is different compared to previous empirical studies, which primarily focus on economic performance in terms of income or employment dynamics. The model is applied to the case of European regions, to get a map of regional resilience in its different dimensions.},

@article{Liu2004,
abstract = {Previous studies on the relationship between macroeconomic aggregates and business failures have been restricted to the description of the short-run relationships among the variables. This paper uses an error-correction model (ECM) to investigate the determinants of UK corporate failures by modelling the short-run and long-run behaviours of corporate failure rates in relation to macroeconomic phenomena over the period 1966-1999. The findings indicate that failure rates are associated with interest rates, credit, profits, price, and corporate birth rates both in the short run and in the long run. Of these macroeconomic variables, interest rate appears to be an important factor influencing failure rates and can be used as a feasible policy instrument to reduce the incidence of corporate failures. The impact of the Insolvency Act 1986 has also been examined and its mitigating effect on corporate failures has been identified.

abstract = {The objective of this descriptive study is to present the profile of women who were assisted at a women&#039;s care center in Londrina, Paran{\'{a}} State, Brazil, and to characterize the cases in relation to types of violence, main complain, environment where the violence occurred and the woman-perpetrator relationship. Information extracted from the records of women assisted in 2001 was processed using the Epi Info software, version 6.04. Of a total of 470 records analyzed, the mean age of the women was 34. The majority (47.2%) reported to be married, 54% had one or two children and 38.7% declared to be responsible for their families. Emotional abuse was the main form of violence (56.4%), followed by physical violence (32.1%). The main perpetrators of violence against women were their own current husband or intimate partner (73.4%) and their house was the space where the majority of episodes of violence occurred. Given the complexity of the problem, which is associated to the social construction of the roles of men and women in the society and to the inequality in gender relations, it can be concluded that the provision of services to attend women who are victimized by violence is of vital importance and that these services should be articulated with health services in the development of preventive actions in order to provide comprehensive care to women.},

abstract = {This paper examines the impact of financial constraints on innovation for established firms.We make use of a direct measure of the existence of financial constraints obtained thanks to a specific survey addressed to French established firms. This is a distinctive feature of this paper as most of previous studies had to rely on proxies (like the cash-flow sensitivity), which may be subject to interpretation problems. The probability to have innovative activities and the probability to face financial constraints are simultaneously estimated by a recursive bivariate probit model.Accounting for the endogeneity of the financial constraint variable, we find that financial constraints significantly reduce the likelihood that firms have innovative activities. The probability to encounter financial constraints is explained by firms' ex ante financing structure and economic performances.},

abstract = {SMEs in the Arab region are widely viewed as important for their multiple roles, notably in employment creation. Yet, they consistently encounter several constraints such as financing, which impede innovation, growth and internationalisation. This paper examines the external finance-innovation nexus for SMEs operating in five non-oil Arab countriesâEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. To achieve this, a probit regression with instrumental variables is applied to firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. The primary findings reveal that the external finance providers are more likely to be reluctant to fund SMEs' innovation; yet, it thrives with finance. The findings accord with the hypothesis that the accessibility to external funds is a mainstay of SMEs' innovation. There is a need to develop policies that support equity and debt capitals for innovative SMEs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of the work done, during the 1968-2005, in the application of statistical and intelligent techniques to solve the bankruptcy prediction problem faced by banks and firms. The review is categorized by taking the type of technique applied to solve this problem as an important dimension. Accordingly, the papers are grouped in the following families of techniques: (i) statistical techniques, (ii) neural networks, (iii) case-based reasoning, (iv) decision trees, (iv) operational research, (v) evolutionary approaches, (vi) rough set based techniques, (vii) other techniques subsuming fuzzy logic, support vector machine and isotonic separation and (viii) soft computing subsuming seamless hybridization of all the above-mentioned techniques. Of particular significance is that in each paper, the review highlights the source of data sets, financial ratios used, country of origin, time line of study and the comparative performance of techniques in terms of prediction accuracy wherever available. The review also lists some important directions for future research. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results show that after controlling for potential endogenous bias due to unobservable firm characteristics, being an innovative firm increases the probability of being financially constrained between 21 and 32%. The nature of the innovation strategy also seems to influence the severity of financing constraints. For financially constrained firms, the main factors that limit future financing for growth ambitions are the lack of collateral, bureaucracy, and too high a price. Findings also indicate that measures to facilitate equity investments and making existing public measures easier are the most important factors for future financing while tax incentives only play a minor role.},

abstract = {O artigo procura discutir os impactos da crise internacional na economia brasileira, com {\^{e}}nfase na virtual paralisia do mercado de cr{\'{e}}dito banc{\'{a}}rio dom{\'{e}}stico a partir de setembro de 2008. Sustenta-se que a din{\^{a}}mica concorrencial banc{\'{a}}ria conduziu {\`{a}} emerg{\^{e}}ncia de pr{\'{a}}ticas de alto risco, cujo potencial desestabilizador veio {\`{a}} tona quando da revers{\~{a}}o das expectativas ante o agravamento da crise financeira internacional e seus efeitos-cont{\'{a}}gio sobre as economias periferias, dentre as quais o Brasil. O conservadorismo dos bancos na fase de retra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o foi exacerbado, no caso brasileiro, pelo prazo relativamente curto do cr{\'{e}}dito e pela exist{\^{e}}ncia de t{\'{i}}tulos p{\'{u}}blicos l{\'{i}}quidos, rent{\'{a}}veis e de baixo risco, que permitem uma r{\'{a}}pida recomposi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos seus portf{\'{o}}lios. A desacelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da atividade produtiva em decorr{\^{e}}ncia da contra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do cr{\'{e}}dito n{\~{a}}o foi mitigada pelo Banco Central, apegado ao seu mandato de guardi{\~{a}}o da estabilidade dos pre{\c{c}}os.This article discusses the impacts of the international crisis on the Brazilian economy, with emphasis on the virtual paralysis of the domestic banking credit market that has occurred since September 2008. It argues that the dynamics of banking competition led to the emergence of high-risk practices. The destabilizing potential of these practices came to light when the aggravation of the international financial crisis and its contagion in peripheral countries such as Brazil caused a reversal of expectations. Generalized conservative behavior by banks during the retraction phase was exacerbated in Brazil by the relatively short credit cycle and by the liquidity, profitability and low-risk of public bonds, allowing a rapid recomposition of portfolios. The Central Bank, sticking to its mandate as the guardian of price stability, failed to move to mitigate the deceleration of productive activities that resulted from the contraction of credit.},

abstract = {The use of bibliometrics is gradually extending to all disciplines. It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

Still, the same research highlights varying challenges that innovative firms in developing economies face, like access to formal credit and external markets. This study examines the effect of a capital budget's proportion for acquiring new technology and sale performance between 2017â2019 using a sample of 101 Kenyan SMEs. The ordinary least square moderated mediation results indicate that: (1) the proportion of the capital budget allocated for the acquisition of technology positively and significantly influences sales; (2) the index of moderated mediation suggests that the perception of firm owner-managers towards the availability of formal credit moderates the mediated relationship between the capital budget's portion spent on technology and sales as mediated by innovation activities. However, the index is insignificant for the second mediator, export longevity. However, in the final model, both the level of innovation and export longevity positively and substantially affect sales.},

Quite casually financial panics were identified as exoge- nous, episodic rather than as endogenous, systemic events. T heargu- ment in this paper is that the stable mechanism which has generated the long swings centers around the cumulative changes in financial variables that take place over the long-swing expansions and contractions.},

Making use of econometric models we find that the amount of bankruptcies (requested and decreed) suffered a strong and immediate impact, reducing it in a significant way as well as the requirement of judicial reorganizations. Finally, using sectorial aggregated credit data, we find an expansion of the credit market, mainly to commercial, rural and services sectors. Additionally we did not evidence changes at the average interest rate charged to firms.},

abstract = {This article brings forward a discussion regarding the definition, classification, and measurement of social positions of origin for research on political elite recruitment. To this end we present several theoretical and methodological strategies to establish the variable " occupation prior to a parliamentary career" and argue in favor of a more analytical criterion than a sociographic one when coding the occupations of those who consider entering the political world. The argument that follows considers that political recruitment could be better apprehended by means of a typology that takes into account not only institutional variables but also, as suggested by Max Weber, social and economic variables. For the empirical test concerning the proposed criteria the data is based on candidates for a federal deputy seat in 2006 and 2010 so as to simulate the efficiency of an alternative classification. This classification is based on three parameters: 1) the flexibility of the candidate's professional career (free time and financial autonomy), 2) the importance of this occupation in a given community (social status) and 3) the candidate's previous affinities with the values and practices of the political world. The results revealed that social cleavages as well as gender cleavages may be enhanced due to the type of professional activity previously exerted by the political candidates even before institutional filters yield their effects.},

abstract = {This study examines factors that increase resilience in innovation of Polish manufacturing firms in an unstable environment. Organizational resilience in innovation is the ability to continuously perform innovation in a turbulent environment and increase knowledge accumulation. In 2008â2012, Poland did not have crisis itself. Short-term slowdown of the economy was accompanied by a breakdown of innovation activities, with a medium-term effect. Based on the Polish Community Innovation Survey panel data for two periods: the innovation crisis (2008â2010), and the innovation pessimism period (2010â2012), this study shows which innovative resources change the probability of innovation continuity in the second period. In our probit model, we explore 42 factors of innovations. We found that financing, R&D and marketing increased the probability of continuity of innovation, but the influence of financing was the strongest. Persistence in innovation in turbulent times hence requires a change in the structure of innovation resources used. Due to the fact that public support on innovation did not increase the likelihood of the continuity of the innovation, a policy change is required. Reliability of our estimation is confirmed by accuracy of prediction of firms, which was 78.2%.},

The present study analyzed the complete publication history of the current top 100 education journals ranked by 5-year impact factor and found that only 0.13% of education articles were replications. Contrary to previous findings in medicine, but similar to psychology, the majority of education replications successfully replicated the original studies. However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. The results emphasize the importance of third-party, direct replications in helping education research improve its ability to shape education policy and practice.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between monetary and macroprudential policies and the banking sector of the Brazilian economy, exploiting its cross-section structure as a source of interrelations between systemic aspects of those policies and the behavior of banks. Impulse-response functions are computed from the estimation of panel-VAR for 56 institutions that were active in the Brazilian banking sector between 2001 and 2013. Among the results, we can highlight the influence of monetary and macroprudential policies on levels of exposure to financial risk, capital and financial stability of banks. There is a complementarity between the instruments of those policies and the stabilization of inflation. The relationships involving banking metrics reveal preference for liquidity in contexts of higher risks, evidence of a competitive banking structure, and formation of capital buffer that lead to financial stability. This confirms the importance of capital requirements as a tool to maintain a stable financial system.},

Para tanto, s{\~{a}}o utilizados dados do Sistema de Informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es sobre Mortalidade do Minist{\'{e}}rio da Sa{\'{u}}de (SIM/MS) de 1999 a 2004, do Censo Demogr{\'{a}}fico de 2000, e das Pesquisas Nacionais por Amostra de Domic{\'{i}}lios do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat{\'{i}}stica (Pnads/IBGE) de 1999 a 2004 â exceto 2000, quando a Pnad n{\~{a}}o foi a campo. O texto consiste tanto de uma an{\'{a}}lise explorat{\'{o}}ria que compara as taxas de mortalidade por homic{\'{i}}dio por idade para diferentes n{\'{i}}veis de instru{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o formal, quanto de uma an{\'{a}}lise de regress{\~{a}}o para achar coeficientes de correla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o parciais. As regress{\~{o}}es s{\~{a}}o estimadas com a utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de dados agrupados e pareados por c{\'{e}}lulas definidas por sexo, idade, regi{\~{a}}o de resid{\^{e}}ncia, cor e escolaridade. Estimou-se um modelo linear de probabilidade de uma regress{\~{a}}o log{\'{i}}stica. O texto refor{\c{c}}a tr{\^{e}}s resultados j{\'{a}} conhecidos. O primeiro {\'{e}} que mulheres sofrem de homic{\'{i}}dio a uma taxa quase dez vezes inferior {\`{a}} dos homens. O segundo, que negros t{\^{e}}m maior probabilidade de morrer v{\'{i}}timas de homic{\'{i}}dio que brancos. O terceiro {\'{e}} que jovens entre 16 e 36 anos perfazem o grande grupo de risco para a morte por homic{\'{i}}dio. O principal resultado inovador {\'{e}} que a escolaridade reduz significativamente o risco de morte por homic{\'{i}}dio, embora sua magnitude mais exata dependa do modelo estimado. As correla{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es encontradas, no entanto, n{\~{a}}o podem ser usadas para inferir causalidade sem a devida cautela. H{\'{a}} certamente vari{\'{a}}veis omitidas, exercendo influ{\^{e}}ncia tanto sobre a morte por homic{\'{i}}dio como sobre o n{\'{i}}vel de instru{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o formal, que podem levar a uma correla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o esp{\'{u}}ria entre os dois. Uma an{\'{a}}lise que se utilize de vari{\'{a}}veis instrumentais para alcan{\c{c}}ar tal objetivo ser{\'{a}} objeto de um trabalho futuro. No entanto, a magnitude do efeito {\'{e}} t{\~{a}}o forte, que mesmo que apenas uma fra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o seja de fato causal, ainda assim a educa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o representa uma das melhores pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas para a redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da viol{\^{e}}ncia letal.},

Its main points are: credit in Brazil is not compatible with the country level of development; there is evidence that Brazil is among the countries where legal protection to creditors is worst; the international experience shows that changes in the bankruptcy law affects the market for credit; and the Brazilian law is extremely outdated.},

abstract = {Purpose: By drawing upon the resource-based view theory, this study investigates the critical resource determinants of start-up companies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in order to encourage the development of entrepreneurship in the region. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach based on multiple linear hierarchical regression analysis was used. Three sets of data were employed. Firstly, the study used the World Bank's Doing Business Report which investigated the ease of starting businesses, access to electricity and access to credit across the 23 MENA countries. Secondly, the study also used the human capital index from the Global Entrepreneurship Index as one of the predictor variables of start-ups. Finally, three specific data sets, namely population, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Gross Domestic Product of the 23 MENA countries were used as control variables due to their importance as determinants of entrepreneurship orientation. Findings: The results of this study indicate that access to two critical resources, namely electricity and credit, have greatly contributed to the formation of start-ups in the MENA region. However, the current level of human capital in the region does not support entrepreneurial activity, hence its inability to support entrepreneurs in the venture creation process. There is a need to augment entrepreneurship education across the region, as well as the provision of entrepreneurial skill development to current and potential entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the study depended heavily on secondary data to examine the determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. Even though the sources of these data are credible, it is impossible to determine any anomalies in the original data. Secondly, the model used in this study is parsimonious in the sense that many more predictor variables could have been explored in understanding the determinants of start-ups in the region. Future research could therefore investigate other factors, such as technology, property rights, the legal system and other important factors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the MENA region. Originality/value: Start-ups are a major source of new employment in a country. However, it is essential to understand the various factors which foster their survival and growth. Even though similar studies have been conducted in various settings, this is one of the few studies which have focused on empirical investigation into the resource determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. The MENA region is noted for its access to abundant oil reserves and other resources. However, this has not culminated in the emergence of successful start-ups. This is what has necessitated this study; to investigate the factors that are responsible for start-up growth in the region. The uniqueness of this study is that it is one of the few studies which have used a three-factor construct in investigating the drivers of start-ups in the MNEA region. This study adopts an exhaustive approach with different variables in different levels of analysis which can provide extra information for further comparative study.},

abstract = {Introdu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o O presente estudo visa realizar uma abordagem acerca de um tema que vem sendo discutido de forma ampla na atualidade, tanto na academia, quanto na sociedade â a viol{\^{e}}ncia de g{\^{e}}nero, ou seja, a viol{\^{e}}ncia contra a mulher. Essas agress{\~{o}}es geralmente provocam o {\'{o}}bito da mulher, pois decorrem de uma agress{\~{a}}o f{\'{i}}sica em grau m{\'{a}}ximo. Nesse contexto busca-se abordar a Lei n{\textordmasculine} 13.104, de 9 de mar{\c{c}}o de 2015, que promulgou a Lei do Feminic{\'{i}}dio (BRASIL, 2015a), cujo objeto {\'{e}} alterar o art. 121 do Decreto-Lei n{\textordmasculine} 2.848, de 7 de dezembro de 1940 â o C{\'{o}}digo Penal brasileiro. O objetivo deste estudo n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} apenas avaliar o impacto dessa mudan{\c{c}}a, mas discutir seus aspectos positivos e negativos, realizando um breve relato hist{\'{o}}rico sobre a viol{\^{e}}ncia contra a mulher e evidenciar o resultado morte. Ressalta-se que tamb{\'{e}}m ser{\~{a}}o levados em considera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o outros tipos de agress{\~{a}}o sofrida pelas mulheres, demonstrando que tais condutas merecem reprova{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, mesmo que diplomas legais j{\'{a}} tenham declinado sobre esse tipo de delito cometido contra as mulheres. Destaca-se, ainda, a import{\^{a}}ncia do engajamento do Poder P{\'{u}}blico e da sociedade para acabar com a desigualdade de g{\^{e}}nero que alimenta e perpetua a viol{\^{e}}ncia e que, segundo Dilma Roussef (BRASIL, 2015b): " o Brasil n{\~{a}}o deve aceitar jamais ser a terra da intoler{\^{a}}ncia e do preconceito, que s{\~{a}}o a semente do racismo, da xenofobia, do autoritarismo e tamb{\'{e}}m do machismo, que faz parte dessa mesma matriz e, muitas vezes, resulta em viol{\^{e}}ncia." Assim, com o intuito de verificar os {\'{i}}ndices de crimes cometidos contra a mulher, especialmente ap{\'{o}}s a promulga{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da Lei Maria da Penha, realiza-se essa pesquisa e se faz uma an{\'{a}}lise dos gr{\'{a}}ficos que apresentam os dados em n{\'{u}}meros sobre o tema a fim de compreender as inova{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es introduzidas no C{\'{o}}digo Penal brasileiro.

Para alcan{\c{c}}ar os objetivos da pesquisa seguiu-se o modelo de estudo descritivo e explicativo, tendo como embasamento priorit{\'{a}}rio o C{\'{o}}digo Penal e artigos publicados sobre o tema, especialmente no que tange {\`{a}}s mudan{\c{c}}as que esta altera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o pode acarretar para a sociedade como um todo.},

Introducci{\'{o}}n Uno de los principales objetivos que persigue deliberadamen-te la Uni{\'{o}}n Europea (UE), y que al mismo tiempo constituy{\'{o}} un requisito indispensable para todos aquellos Estados miembros que deseaban acceder a la tercera y {\'{u}}ltima fase de la Uni{\'{o}}n Monetaria Europea (UME), es el de la consecuci{\'{o}}n de mayores niveles de convergencia econ{\'{o}}mica entre sus Estados miem-bros. Pero, a pesar de ello, lo cierto es que en la actualidad la UE se sigue caracterizando por la existencia de importantes dis-paridades entre las distintas econom{\'{i}}as que la conforman. No obstante, se espera que los avances que se vayan registrando en el proceso de integraci{\'{o}}n econ{\'{o}}mica contribuyan a la atenua- La consideraci{\'{o}}n de la literatura financiera regional resulta {\'{u}}til para el an{\'{a}}lisis de la influencia que puede ejer-cer el sector financiero en el proceso de convergencia entre las econom{\'{i}}as de la Uni{\'{o}}n Europea que forman parte de la zona euro. En este trabajo se analiza esta literatura desde la {\'{o}}ptica de la estructura de mercado, dis-tingui{\'{e}}ndose tres estructuras diferentes que podr{\'{i}}an caracterizar al mercado financiero europeo: mercados de capitales perfectos, segmentaci{\'{o}}n institucional y segmentaci{\'{o}}n de mercado. Si bien en la mayor{\'{i}}a de los estu-dios sobre la integraci{\'{o}}n financiera en Europa se ha empleado la primera de las estructuras mencionadas, la de los mercados en competencia perfecta, existen algunas razones de peso para argumentar que incluso a pesar de la existencia de una plena integraci{\'{o}}n en el plano monetario, es probable que la estructura del sistema finan-ciero europeo se caracterice por la persistencia de alg{\'{u}}n tipo de segmentaci{\'{o}}n, sea {\'{e}}sta de tipo institucional o de mercado.

abstract = {The finance literature contains many studies that focus on explaining and/or predicting individual failures using firm-specific finacial data. In contrast there has been only a very modest amount of research into the relationships between aggregate failure activity and macroeconomic/market conditions. These studies, in addition, provide very limited insights into the structural (especially lead-lag) relationships between failure activity and macroeconomic/market conditions. This study employs a data-based multiple time series approach to develop an explanatory model for describing changes in aggregate failure activity relative to changes in financial markets variables during the 1950 through 1983 time period. It is our contention that failures are essentially a credit or money market conditions phenomenon. Results suggest that aggregate failure activity lags behind the volatility of interest rates and the cost of short-term credit. Furthermore, there is some evidence that aggregate failure activity also lags behind the availability of short-term credit. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {The paper adds to the literature on the barriers to innovation in two ways. First, we assess comparatively what mostly constrains firms' ability to translate investment in innovation activity into new products and processes, whether it is mainly finance, as most of the literature would suggest, or whether it is mostly knowledge and market-related aspects. Second, we suggest a method to correct for the sample selection bias that often affects empirical contributions to this scholarship. By filtering out firms that are not interested in innovation from those that struggle to engage in it, we obtain a relevant sample of potential innovators, which allows us to analyse the comparative effect of financial and non-financial barriers on innovation success. We find that demand-side factors, particularly concentrated market structure and lack of demand, are as important as financial constraints in determining firms' innovation failures. This evidence redirects attention from financial to non-financial barriers by considering traditional demand, market structure and regulation factors involved in reduced firm innovation performance. The empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel of firm-level data from four waves of the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) between 2002 and 2010 merged with data from the UK Business Structure Database.},

These are aspects of economics with which Minsky is not usually associated, but which lie at the foundation of his later work. They include critical remarks on Cambridge economics. The paper then draws out some antecedents of Minsky's ideas in the work of Henry Simons, and highlights the Marshallian monetary analysis that he adopted. It is argued that this analysis is incompatible with the Kaleckian theory of profits that Minsky was later to adopt.},

With given total costs, output is larger the larger is the output elasticity of the cheapest input. Technological congruence is a powerful tool that helps grasping the economic complexity of technological change with respect to the determinants of the direction of technological change and its effects in terms of growth accounting and specialization, both at the firm and the system level. Its appreciation stems directly from the advances of the economics of innovation in understanding the endogenous determinants of the introduction and diffusion of directed technological changes. Technological congruence is most relevant to influence the actual levels of total factor productivity of new technologies and â consequently â to shape the competitive advance of firms and countries.},

abstract = {In a scenario where there is no vaccine for COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to contain the spread of the virus and the collapse of the health system in the affected regions. One of these measures is social distancing, which aims to reduce interactions in the community by closing public and private establishments that involve crowds of people. The lockdown presupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a more extreme measure of social distancing. Based on geolocation data provided by Google for six categories of physical spaces, this article identifies the variations in the circulation of people in South America for different types of social distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, population mobility trends for a group of countries between February 15, 2020 and May 16, 2020 were analyzed. To summarize these trends in a single metric, a general circulation index was created, and to identify regional mobility patterns, descriptive analyzes of spatial autocorrelation (global and local Moran index) were used. The first hypothesis of this study is that countries with a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility of the population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil and Colombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partially confirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtained in the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis. In general, the observed data shows that less rigid lockdown or social distancing measures are necessary, however, they are not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction in the circulation of people during the pandemic.},

@article{Mazzucato2015b,
abstract = {This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both âfinanceâ and âcapital developmentâ very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition â to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge â the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of productionâto complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to âfinancialisation of the real economy,â the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi's famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking âvampire squid.â In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky's ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter's views on financing innovation.},

By means of descriptive statistics, we underline the particularities of Police and Military candidates for a federal deputy office. Findings from this research indicated abrupt changes, from one election to another, among the parties in which these candidates were most highly concentrated. If the transition from police to politics during the 1990s occurred through major right-wing parties, in the 2010 decade it takes place through small parties without clear ideological identities (âphysiological partiesâ). In addition to the constitutional impediment of military personnel affiliation to political parties, the lack of a systematic preference for a party college type may be the effect of a strategic behavior, since not only is it easier to obtain a nomination within these small parties, but there also exists a greater lenience toward personalist discourses, such as those espoused by these policeperson-candidates. This behavior is also related to a negative view of traditional politics and established politicians within major parties as well as a condemnation of political programs with overly generic ideological appeals. Such candidates favor certain specific agendas, such as the demands from their own professional corporations.},

abstract = {Shelter in place orders (SIPOs) require residents to remain home for all but essential activities such as purchasing food or medicine, caring for others, exercise, or traveling for employment deemed essential. Between March 19 and April 20, 2020, 40 states and the District of Columbia adopted SIPOs. This study explores the impact of SIPOs on health, with particular attention to heterogeneity in their impacts. First, using daily state-level social distancing data from SafeGraph and a difference-indifferences approach, we document that adoption of a SIPO was associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time. Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced case reductions grew larger over time. However, this average effect masks important heterogeneity across states-early adopters and high population density states appear to reap larger benefits from their SIPOs. Finally, we find that statewide SIPOs were associated with a reduction in coronavirus-related deaths, but estimated mortality effects were imprecisely estimated.},

The interest rate is set by banks as a markup over a base rate exogenously determined by the monetary authority. The banking markup varies with changes in capacity utilisation, while the debt ratio varies with changes in the rates of interest, capital accumulation and growth. Regarding dynamics, it is shown the possibility of relating the stability properties of a system with the interest rate and the debt ratio as state variables to the prevailing Minskyan regimeâhedge, speculative or Ponzi.},

abstract = {Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases. (WHO) emergency response for infectious diseases. The number of cases was accelerating in China and subsequently all over the world; however, the publications of the COVID-19's potential transmission and effectiveness of government interventions were limited. It is urgent to provide more scientific information for a better understanding of the novel coronavirus and further containment of the outbreak.},

abstract = {The idea that skills, technology, and knowledge, are spatially concentrated, has a long academic tradition. Yet, only recently this hypothesis has been empirically formalized and corroborated at multiple spatial scales, for different economic activities, and for a diversity of institutional regimes. The new synthesis is an empirical principle describing the probability that a region entersâor exitsâan economic activity as a function of the number of related activities present in that location. In this paper we summarize some of the recent empirical evidence that has generalized the principle of relatedness to a fact describing the entry and exit of products, industries, occupations, and technologies, at the national, regional, and metropolitan scales. We conclude by describing some of the policy implications and future avenues of research implied by this robust empirical principle.},

abstract = {The study examined the extent to which lack of access to external funding constitutes a barrier to innovation for small businesses operating in traditional industries. The findings indicate that, these businesses do not view lack of access to funding as a barrier to innovation for any of the four types of innovation: product, process, marketing, or organizational. However, for most of the innovations they promoted, the levels of innovation were relatively low, and which naturally entails relatively low risk to businesses. The findings also indicate that, there is a relationship between product and marketing levels of innovation and lack of access to external funding. The study's contribution lies in its focus on small businesses operating in traditional industriesâbusinesses which though, essential to economic growth, have garnered less separate attention in the innovation sphere. The study points to a vicious circle in which these businesses do not promote innovation at high levels that would advance their own competitive advantage and require external funding. Because this funding is not within their reach, they continue promoting low-level innovation, and so on and so forth. The study may practically contribute by assisting policymakers as they draw plans dedicated to supporting innovation in small businesses.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore different channels to explain the disparities in COVID-19 incidence across New York City neighborhoods. To do so, we estimate several regression models to assess the statistical relevance of different variables such as neighborhood characteristics and occupations. Our results suggest occupations are crucial for explaining the observed patterns, with those with a high degree of human interaction being more likely to be exposed to the virus. Moreover, after controlling for occupations, commuting patterns no longer play a significant role. The relevance of occupations is robust to the inclusion of demographics, with some of them, such as income or the share of Asians, having no statistical significance. On the other hand, racial disparities still persist for Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites, although their magnitudes are economically small. Additionally, we perform the same analysis over a time window to evaluate how different channels interact with the progression of the pandemic, as well as with the health policies that have been set in place. While the coefficient magnitudes of many occupations and demographics decrease over time, we find evidence consistent with higher intra-household contagion as days go by. Moreover, our findings also suggest a selection on testing, whereby those residents in worse conditions are more likely to get tested, with such selection decreasing over time as tests become more widely available. * We thank Michael Dickstein and Daniel Waldinger for their useful comments.

abstract = {This research addresses the study of the effect of regional factors in the development of eco-innovations in the firm. We assume the hypothesis of regional heterogeneity, that is, geographical factors and the regional heterogeneity play an important role in determining the innovations in the firms. In this line, we will approach our study from the perspective of regional innovation systems (RISs). Therefore, our research question involves the evaluation of regional factors as determinants of eco-innovation developing in the firm. To examine these questions, the PITEC database that covers the period 2011â2013 was used. Overall, 5,461 firms have been employed for the ordinal logit regression model. This research contributes to the studies of eco-innovation, extending the investigation into drivers of eco-innovation, and highlights the impact that RIS has on the eco-innovative development in the firm. We find that regional interaction and regional characteristics are key elements for the development of eco-innovation in firms. Thus, the density of companies in the region, the regional per capita income, and the existence of financing mechanisms are key elements for the eco-innovative development in the firm.},

With Spanish CIS data we find evidence that the three channels contributed to the fall in the proportion of firms that introduce technological innovations during the Great Recession, compared with the proportion of innovators in the years of expansion. The research methodology consists on estimating a multiprobit model with the probability that firms introduce technological innovations, the probability that firms abandon ongoing innovation projects, and the probability that firms perceive the obstacles to innovate as high.},

abstract = {The need to pay some attention to the issues of investment processes undertaken in enterprises and explore this topic is a direct result of the important role that enterprises play in the economyâwith particular emphasis on the SMEs. From the company's point of view, it is crucial to obtain economic effects as a result of the implemented investment. The aim of the study was to analyze the results of tangible investments in enterprises in Ma{\l}opolska province in Poland, in two groups of entitiesâthose that implemented investments using EU subsidies and those that financed investments from other sources without using EU aid. This is a unique research in the field of analysis and presentation of investment data in enterprises, especially in relation to companies using EU funds. There is no comparative assessment of investments in enterprises on this topic in the scientific literature (concerning EU subsidies). For this reason, comparing the effects of investment activities between the two groups of enterprises studiedâusing and not using EU subsidiesâfills the research gap in this regard. The study was based on the critical analysis of domestic and foreign literature, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results of a survey among 160 enterprises using the CSAQ method, additionally extended by interviews with selected respondents. Data presentation uses a descriptive approach in combination with statistical analysis. A multiple linear regression model (MLR) was also used to verify hypotheses. Research results show that undertaking investment activities contributes to obtaining favorable results in enterprises, regardless of the source of investment financing. The source of financing the investment is not important for the results achieved in the enterprise. However, representatives of companies who received EU subsidies assess their market position higher after investment relative to companies that used other sources of financing for this purpose. Entities that have received EU subsidies have a stronger perception of investment as an important factor determining the company's development. In addition, variables were identified using the MLR model that affect the assessment of the financial position of enterprises in both groups of entities. This article supplements the knowledge on the economic effects of investments implemented by enterprises in the SME sector in Poland in a situation where these entities used and did not benefit from EU subsidies during 2007â2015.},

abstract = {In the present day, innovation has become a key element of competitive advantage. However, most countries are failing in their innovative activities, and their innovative performance is below that of the EU average. Therefore, the European Commission annually publishes its Innovation Union Scoreboard, which provides a comparative assessment of the EU member states' research and innovation performance. The countries are divided into four groups according to their innovation performance: innovation leaders, strong innovators, moderate innovators, and modest innovators. In this paper, we have selected countries whose innovation performance was close to, below, or well below that of the EU average in 2015 and we have performed microeconomic analysis of the situation in these countries' firms to analyse the conditions of their innovation environment and uncover barriers to their innovation activities. We analysed firms in the manufacturing industries in Slovenia (a strong innovator), Croatia (a moderate innovator), and Romania (a modest innovator) by using original multiple regression models and data from the 2010-2012 Community Innovation Survey. The results demonstrate the different backgrounds for innovation in each country. In Romania, there is a lack of both a satisfactory environment for innovation and sufficient capacity for absorbing public funds; investment into innovation-related activities is also absent. In Croatia, the innovation potential has not been fully exploited. However, we show that the appropriate targeting of innovation determinants (e.g., collaboration with different partners or public financing) could lead to the creation of synergies and spillover effects that would be able to support their innovative activities and strengthen the country's competitiveness. There is a completely different situation in Slovenia. Firms there effectively utilize the various determinants of innovation activities, and these determinants have strong influence when utilized on their own. On the other hand, results also show that certain significant combinations of determinants of innovation activities are missing in Slovenia. In conclusion, we have proposed practical implications for policy makers that would be able to support innovative activities and help each country to improve its innovation ranking.},

The findings indicate that, these businesses do not view lack of access to funding as a barrier to innovation for any of the four types of innovation: product, process, marketing, or organizational. However, for most of the innovations they promoted, the levels of innovation were relatively low, and which naturally entails relatively low risk to businesses. The findings also indicate that, there is a relationship between product and marketing levels of innovation and lack of access to external funding. The study's contribution lies in its focus on small businesses operating in traditional industriesâbusinesses which though, essential to economic growth, have garnered less separate attention in the innovation sphere. The study points to a vicious circle in which these businesses do not promote innovation at high levels that would advance their own competitive advantage and require external funding. Because this funding is not within their reach, they continue promoting low-level innovation, and so on and so forth. The study may practically contribute by assisting policymakers as they draw plans dedicated to supporting innovation in small businesses.},

abstract = {Aim of study: This paper determines the preferences for debt or equity â common stock and self-financing â that are shown by agri-food companies to finance innovation investment strategies and identify the monitoring role that third-party funding providers can play. Area of study: A sample of 41,109 Spanish SMEs (364,020 observations). Material and methods: The information was obtained from the SABI database, using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator and a logistic regression like contrast methodologies. Main results: Spanish agri-food companies undertake innovation projects by financing these investments through owners' resour-ces, mainly from current common stock, as they are independent of these companies' capacity to generate internal funds. This may be conditioned by the problems of severe negative self-financing presented by this sector in Spain which make it difficult to use retained earnings as a source of financing for new investments; 30% of these firms have a negative self-financing level of EUR 100,000 as the losses accumulated by economic activity are higher than the reserves provided. Research highlights: Agri-food companies prefer to use owners' funds to finance innovation projects which allows them to maintain the concentration of power, a decision that is reinforced by the limitation to credit access due to innovation creates intangible assets that are not usually accepted as collateral by financial institutions. Meanwhile, given the particularities of these companies â instability and liquidity problems due to the need for funds of operations â the recourse to debt is an appropriate control mechanism to prevent overinvestment decisions.},

We also look at the legal institutions that determine (and are determined by) the relationship between public and private actors. Policy measures to institutionalize rewards in a way that promote more equitable publicâprivate partnerships can be understood as attempts to mediate asymmetric power relations, tensions and conflicting views among multiple stakeholders, as well as building a shared notion of the value and legitimacy of the role of the state.

Using panel data we find that R&D spending of firms devoting a significant fraction of R&D to cutting-edge projects is curtailed by credit constraints while routine R&D investments are not.

The model is tested to make use of the DriscollâKraay standard error estimation and various regression models, based on detailed Chinese listed ï¬rm-level data covering the period from 2011 to 2017. Our baseline results show that ER have produced a crowding out effect of R&D input and inhibited patent outputs; as a consequence, the âweakâ version of the Porter hypothesis is not underpinned in A-share stocks listed firms. Further tests indicate that FC have a mediating effect on the relationship between ER and TI. The moderating effect of FC between ER and TI is mixed. The effect of ER on TI is affected by the threshold effect of FCâthe lower FC can better support the innovation compensation effect or alleviate the crowding out effect of ER.

Using the panel data of Chinese SMEs from 2002-2014, it was found that although the R & D investments of SMEs are restricted by financial constraints, trade credit can maintain the sustainability of enterprises' R & D investment. Private enterprises are more reliant on trade credit, which can be intensified during periods of monetary tightening. Considering the counterfactual framework and the endogenous problems, the empirical results were also robust when using propensity score matching.

abstract = {This study aims to explore the direct effect and spillover effect of innovation policy in the distribution and dynamic evolution of the regional innovation from the perspective of innovation motivation using the spatial econometric model. Substantive innovation and strategic innovation in one region could affect innovation in another region. In addition, the direct effect and spatial spillover effect of innovation policy could significantly affect innovation; however, they exert a higher impact on substantive innovation. Considering different policy tools, we found that government subsidies exert a significant positive impact on substantive innovation and strategic innovation, whereas financial institution loans exert a significant negative impact on substantive innovation and strategic innovation. And for the impact range, the government subsidies are higher than that of financial institution loans. Furthermore, this study reveals the leading environmental factors affecting regional innovation and provide a policy basis to promote the construction of an innovation-oriented country. Copyright:},

abstract = {Technology innovation is a motivating force for sustainable development. The recognition and measurement of influencing factors are a basic prerequisite of technology innovation research. In response to the gaps and shortages of existing theories and methods, this paper builds the impact indicators of technology innovation, the proposed FOA-GRNN model, and analyzes the influencing factors, regional differences and temporal variations of technology innovation based on industrial above-scale enterprises of 31 provinces in China from 2008 to 2015. The empirical results show that innovation investment is a determinant of technology innovation in China, and is more and more significant; meanwhile a wide gap of innovation resource between Eastern China and Western China exists. In general, the enterprise scale has a negative effect: with enlargement of enterprise in China, the innovation efficiency of enterprise will decline, while the effect has regional disparity, with positive influence in Central and Western China, and negative influence in Eastern China. Government support has negative effects on technology innovation: indirect equity investment contributes more to technology innovation than direct fund support. Innovation environment has positive and weak effects on technology innovation, but it is the biggest obstacle in Western China, and the innovation environment in China has improved continuously. This paper provides new evidence that can shine some light on determining the factors affecting technology innovation, and also presents a novel approach, which comprises characteristics of nonlinear function approximation, high accuracy and a small sample.},

This article examines the effect of trade credit maintaining sustainable R & D investment of SMEs under financial constraints. Using the panel data of Chinese SMEs from 2002-2014, it was found that although the R & D investments of SMEs are restricted by financial constraints, trade credit can maintain the sustainability of enterprises' R & D investment. Private enterprises are more reliant on trade credit, which can be intensified during periods of monetary tightening. Considering the counterfactual framework and the endogenous problems, the empirical results were also robust when using propensity score matching. To summarize, this article develops a new explanation for maintaining sustainable R & D investment of SMEs under financial constraints in developing countries.},

abstract = {The paper adds to the literature on the barriers to innovation in two ways. First, we assess comparatively what mostly constrains firms' ability to translate investment in innovation activity into new products and processes, whether it is mainly finance, as most of the literature would suggest, or whether it is mostly knowledge and market-related aspects. Second, we suggest a method to correct for the sample selection bias that often affects empirical contributions to this scholarship. By filtering out firms that are not interested in innovation from those that struggle to engage in it, we obtain a relevant sample of potential innovators, which allows us to analyse the comparative effect of financial and non-financial barriers on innovation success. We find that demand-side factors, particularly concentrated market structure and lack of demand, are as important as financial constraints in determining firms' innovation failures. This evidence redirects attention from financial to non-financial barriers by considering traditional demand, market structure and regulation factors involved in reduced firm innovation performance. The empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel of firm-level data from four waves of the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) between 2002 and 2010 merged with data from the UK Business Structure Database.},

Identifying the main determinants of entrepreneurial activity is important for helping the decision makers in adopting adequate measures to support the creation and development of new businesses. The turbulent economic environment in recent years dominated by economic and financial crises, resulting in a reduction in economic growth but also in an increase in unemployment, has led decision makers to turn their attention again to the determinant factors of entrepreneurship. Starting from those stated above, through this paper we aim to investigate the impact of some macroeconomic, individual and business environment-related factors on the dynamics of entrepreneurial activity in 18 European Union (EU) countries for a period of 14 years (2002-2015). We use three regression models and we apply panel data fixed effect model approach. The results of our study highlight that inflation rate, foreign direct investments, access to finance and total tax rate are the main macroeconomic determinants of entrepreneurship. Also, we find that all individual business-related factors considered in the analysis have a significant impact on total entrepreneurship rate.},

Knowledge on the nature, degree and frequency of innovations provide opportunities for supporting the competitive advantages of smallholder dairy farmers to sustainably break away from the poverty cycle. Little attention has been given to measuring the performance and drivers of innovation for improvement of smallholder dairying in Malawi. Without understanding innovation, it is difficult to make policies and provide targeted, impactful support to smallholder farmers. This study is based on a cross sectional survey of 193 smallholder farmers in Lilongwe and Blantyre milk shed areas of Malawi. Innovation indices were computed to measure the innovation performance and further analysed to determine the drivers and barriers of innovations. Four categories of innovations namely; feeding, breeding, market, and animal health innovations are presented. The innovation index for the smallholder farmers was less than half (0.37) which is relatively lower in comparison to developed industries. The key driver was access to credit along with training, access to information and networking. For efficient and sustainable management of innovations, clear policies should be put in place to ensure formal structures for supporting continuity of innovations through enhancements in social networking among the farmers and cost effective mechanisms for accessing quality inputs.},

Previous studies emphasized the role of public R&D to encourage the technological innovation in the private sector. However, the effect of global economic crisis with respect to the public and private R&D link has been somewhat neglected in the empirical literature. Based on system GMM estimation, we found that public R&D complements private R&D in pre and post economic crisis. However, the strength of their complementary association is found strong in pre-economic crisis. In sum, the results indicate that continuous support to public R&D in pre and post economic crisis accelerate the technological innovation in the private sector. This study implies that public support to R&D is a good strategy for an economy to confront economic crisis effectively by increasing the technological innovation in the private sector. For policy makers, it is suggested that care must be taken while investing in the R&D, the investment is to be based on the ratio between R&D expenditure to number of R&D workers.},

A combination of technological barriers combined with economic barriers, institutional and political barriers contribute to sub-optimal low-carbon investment all along the innovation cycle. Policy makers need to take a systemic approach to enable the redirection of diverse private financial sources. Instruments range from cutting âdirty' (R&D) subsidies and support for clean technology innovation and diffusion, levelling the institutional playing field and making risks of high-carbon and low-carbon technologies transparent to providing a consistent but adaptive long-term transition strategy. This would allow financiers to gradually shift their investments away from high-carbon mainstream markets and scale low-carbon technology niche-markets. However financiers also need to sharpen their competencies with regard to new clean technologies and markets.},

Analysis was based on their patent and annual report data and used multiple input-output SFA model, system GMM, and panel fixed-effect model. The results are as follows. (1) There is significant variation in overall technological innovation efficiency of listed companies in the internet industry, and there is a downward trend. The technological innovation efficiency of business that use financing innovation methods is higher than those that do not. (2) The number of patents and intangible capital investment of internet businesses increase obviously every year, but there is no corresponding increase in the efficiency of technological innovation, and little intangible capital investment of non-financing innovation businesses. Thus, determining how to effectively improve the overall quality of patents and the efficiency of intangible capital investment is essential to improve the efficiency of technological innovation for Chinese internet businesses. (3) There is a term mismatch in the investment and financing of internet businesses in China. The financing structure between the financing innovation and non-financing innovation businesses has different impacts on the efficiency of technological innovation. And nowadays, more financing channels are short-term debt financing channels which invest in projects to improve the efficiency of technological innovation due to the pressure of debt repayment and the need to protect shareholders' interests. (4) In the panel regression, the coefficients of Icd and Roa are significantly negative, suggesting that the investment efficiency of internet businesses needs to be improved.},

The main conclusions are as follows. First, corporate financialization has a speculative tendency instead of strategic capital investment. Second, corporate financialization shows heterogeneous impact on green technology innovation, which is dominated by capital expenditure. Third, the heterogeneity is reflected in two aspects: attribute characteristics and external environment. The attribute characteristics of the enterprise includes whether the industry belongs to pollution industry and the ownership structure. The external environment includes the location of enterprise and the degree of financing constraints. Fourth, there are significant differences between attribute characteristics and external environment of enterprises in the impact of financialization decision-making behavior. The deviation caused by enterprise attributes is less than 10%, but the deviation caused by external environment is close to 80%.},

The results show that after controlling for potential endogenous bias due to unobservable firm characteristics, being an innovative firm increases the probability of being financially constrained between 21 and 32%. The nature of the innovation strategy also seems to influence the severity of financing constraints. For financially constrained firms, the main factors that limit future financing for growth ambitions are the lack of collateral, bureaucracy, and too high a price. Findings also indicate that measures to facilitate equity investments and making existing public measures easier are the most important factors for future financing while tax incentives only play a minor role.},

The authors organize and integrate the diverse body of empirical literature relating to SOI and, in doing so, develop a synthesized conceptual framework onto which SOI practices and processes can be mapped. Sustainability-oriented innovation involves making intentional changes to an organization's philosophy and values, as well as to its products, processes or practices to serve the specific purpose of creating and realizing social and environmental value in addition to economic returns. A critical reading of previous literature relating to environmental management and sustainability reveals how little attention has been paid to SOI, and what exists is only partial. In a review of 100 scholarly articles and 27 grey sources drawn from the period of the three Earth Summits (1992, 2002 and 2012), the authors address four specific deficiencies that have given rise to these limitations: the meaning of SOI; how it has been conceptualized; its treatment as a dichotomous phenomenon; and a general failure to reflect more contemporary practices. The authors adopt a framework synthesis approach involving first constructing an initial architecture of the landscape grounded in previous studies, which is subsequently iteratively tested, shaped, refined and reinforced into a model of SOI with data drawn from included studies: so advancing theoretical development in the field of SOI.},

To achieve this, a probit regression with instrumental variables is applied to firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. The primary findings reveal that the external finance providers are more likely to be reluctant to fund SMEs' innovation; yet, it thrives with finance. The findings accord with the hypothesis that the accessibility to external funds is a mainstay of SMEs' innovation. There is a need to develop policies that support equity and debt capitals for innovative SMEs.},

However, most countries are failing in their innovative activities, and their innovative performance is below that of the EU average. Therefore, the European Commission annually publishes its Innovation Union Scoreboard, which provides a comparative assessment of the EU member states' research and innovation performance. The countries are divided into four groups according to their innovation performance: innovation leaders, strong innovators, moderate innovators, and modest innovators. In this paper, we have selected countries whose innovation performance was close to, below, or well below that of the EU average in 2015 and we have performed microeconomic analysis of the situation in these countries' firms to analyse the conditions of their innovation environment and uncover barriers to their innovation activities. We analysed firms in the manufacturing industries in Slovenia (a strong innovator), Croatia (a moderate innovator), and Romania (a modest innovator) by using original multiple regression models and data from the 2010-2012 Community Innovation Survey. The results demonstrate the different backgrounds for innovation in each country. In Romania, there is a lack of both a satisfactory environment for innovation and sufficient capacity for absorbing public funds; investment into innovation-related activities is also absent. In Croatia, the innovation potential has not been fully exploited. However, we show that the appropriate targeting of innovation determinants (e.g., collaboration with different partners or public financing) could lead to the creation of synergies and spillover effects that would be able to support their innovative activities and strengthen the country's competitiveness. There is a completely different situation in Slovenia. Firms there effectively utilize the various determinants of innovation activities, and these determinants have strong influence when utilized on their own. On the other hand, results also show that certain significant combinations of determinants of innovation activities are missing in Slovenia. In conclusion, we have proposed practical implications for policy makers that would be able to support innovative activities and help each country to improve its innovation ranking.},

abstract = {Innovation is widely recognized as a key factor in the competitiveness of nations and firms. Also, it has played a significant role in business ecosystem, and the achievement of science and technology have greatly spread to the development of both local and global firms. However, there are factors that discourage the applicable capabilities of such innovations on business processes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degrees of barriers which block the use of innovation in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam namely human resources, access to finance, transparency, tax rates, trade regulations and customs. The secondary data used were gathered from Enterprise survey (ES) of 479 small and medium enterprises in five different regions (Red River Delta, North Central Coast, Central Coast Area, South East and Mekong River Delta), which are conducted by the World Bank Group from 2015 to 2017. The binary logistic regression and Logit Model were used to process variables and data analysis. The major findings revealed that barriers of accessing financial capacity, trading regulations and customs have positively affected on innovation of SMEs in Vietnam. Finally, it could be emphasized that HR training has the strongest impact on innovation changes of the enterprises by 55.7%.},

abstract = {The paper adds to the literature on the barriers to innovation in two ways. First, we assess comparatively what mostly constrains firms' ability to translate investment in innovation activity into new products and processes, whether it is mainly finance, as most of the literature would suggest, or whether it is mostly knowledge and market-related aspects. Second, we suggest a method to correct for the sample selection bias that often affects empirical contributions to this scholarship. By filtering out firms that are not interested in innovation from those that struggle to engage in it, we obtain a relevant sample of potential innovators, which allows us to analyse the comparative effect of financial and non-financial barriers on innovation success. We find that demand-side factors, particularly concentrated market structure and lack of demand, are as important as financial constraints in determining firms' innovation failures. This evidence redirects attention from financial to non-financial barriers by considering traditional demand, market structure and regulation factors involved in reduced firm innovation performance. The empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced panel of firm-level data from four waves of the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) between 2002 and 2010 merged with data from the UK Business Structure Database.},

These policies triggered concerns over the impact of debt financing on firms' technological innovation activities. Based on a sample of 225 listed computer and telecommunications equipment firms in China within 2008â2015, this study explored the effect of debt financing on two types of technological innovation, namely radical and incremental innovation. Specifically, both the direct effect of debt financing on technological innovation and its moderating effect on the relationship between R&D intensity and technological innovation were investigated. Results of this study reveal that radical innovation decreases with debt financing at decreasing rates, while incremental innovation is not affected by debt financing itself. In addition, debt financing interacted with R&D intensity exerts positive effect on both radical and incremental innovation. This study adds meaningful insights to the literature on financing technological innovation and builds a bridge connecting macroeconomic policies to firm activities.},

Five-hundred and fifty (550) SME owners were randomly selected for the study. Information was sourced through the use of questionnaires. Tobit model was used for the analysis. Sales value of new products was used a proxy for new products innovation. The determinants were grouped into two types thus innovation expenditure and sources of innovation expenditure. Sources of innovation expenditure have significant influence on new products innovation. From the finding foreign capital, government tax credit, and subsidies had significantly influence on new products innovation. SMEs specific attributes such as patent and having overseas partners influence new product innovation.Policies and programs geared towards government tax credit, subsidies, patent rights and inflow of foreign capital into SME sector should be encouraged since they have the potential of promoting product innovation in the sector.

Besides environmental regulations (ER), financing is a critical factor affecting corporate technological innovation (TI). This study develops an integrated model to empirically investigate the interrelationship between ER, financial constraints (FC), and TI. The model is tested to make use of the DriscollâKraay standard error estimation and various regression models, based on detailed Chinese listed ï¬rm-level data covering the period from 2011 to 2017. Our baseline results show that ER have produced a crowding out effect of R&D input and inhibited patent outputs; as a consequence, the âweakâ version of the Porter hypothesis is not underpinned in A-share stocks listed firms. Further tests indicate that FC have a mediating effect on the relationship between ER and TI. The moderating effect of FC between ER and TI is mixed. The effect of ER on TI is affected by the threshold effect of FCâthe lower FC can better support the innovation compensation effect or alleviate the crowding out effect of ER. Thus, our findings offer new ideas for supporting financing mechanism of environmental governance to stimulate R&D innovation of listed companies.},

This article examines the effect of trade credit maintaining sustainable R & D investment of SMEs under financial constraints. Using the panel data of Chinese SMEs from 2002-2014, it was found that although the R & D investments of SMEs are restricted by financial constraints, trade credit can maintain the sustainability of enterprises' R & D investment. Private enterprises are more reliant on trade credit, which can be intensified during periods of monetary tightening. Considering the counterfactual framework and the endogenous problems, the empirical results were also robust when using propensity score matching. To summarize, this article develops a new explanation for maintaining sustainable R & D investment of SMEs under financial constraints in developing countries.},

abstract = {Aim of study: This paper determines the preferences for debt or equity â common stock and self-financing â that are shown by agri-food companies to finance innovation investment strategies and identify the monitoring role that third-party funding providers can play. Area of study: A sample of 41,109 Spanish SMEs (364,020 observations). Material and methods: The information was obtained from the SABI database, using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator and a logistic regression like contrast methodologies. Main results: Spanish agri-food companies undertake innovation projects by financing these investments through owners' resour-ces, mainly from current common stock, as they are independent of these companies' capacity to generate internal funds. This may be conditioned by the problems of severe negative self-financing presented by this sector in Spain which make it difficult to use retained earnings as a source of financing for new investments; 30% of these firms have a negative self-financing level of EUR 100,000 as the losses accumulated by economic activity are higher than the reserves provided. Research highlights: Agri-food companies prefer to use owners' funds to finance innovation projects which allows them to maintain the concentration of power, a decision that is reinforced by the limitation to credit access due to innovation creates intangible assets that are not usually accepted as collateral by financial institutions. Meanwhile, given the particularities of these companies â instability and liquidity problems due to the need for funds of operations â the recourse to debt is an appropriate control mechanism to prevent overinvestment decisions.},

The paper takes the post-Keynesian theory as reference, associating it with the neo-Schumpeterian analysis of innovation dynamics. First, it is argued that knowledge plays a crucial role in building agents' confidence, emphasizing that radical innovations are more dependent on the accumulation of codified knowledge, given the higher degree of uncertainty associated with this type of innovation, while incremental innovations are more dependent on tacit knowledge about the current market conditions and technological trajectory. Second, it is argued that the accumulation of knowledge and the constant introduction of innovations foster the creation of a convention to innovate, which facilitates the decision to pursue innovations by influencing long-term expectations.},

Methods A two-stage evidence synthesis: (1) a systematic map to describe the key characteristics of the evidence base, followed by (2) a systematic review of the studies stakeholders prioritised as relevant from the map on the effectiveness and efficiency of peer review âinnovations'. Standard processes included literature searching, duplicate inclusion criteria screening, study keyword coding, data extraction, critical appraisal and study synthesis. Results A total of 83 studies from 15 countries were included in the systematic map. The evidence base is diverse, investigating many aspects of the systems for, and processes of, peer review. The systematic review included eight studies from Australia, Canada, and the USA, evaluating a broad range of peer review innovations. These studies showed that simplifying the process by shortening proposal forms, using smaller reviewer panels, or expediting processes can speed up the review process and reduce costs, but this might come at the expense of peer review quality, a key aspect that has not been assessed. Virtual peer review using videoconferencing or teleconferencing appears promising for reducing costs by avoiding the need for reviewers to travel, but again any consequences for quality have not been adequately assessed. Conclusions There is increasing international research activity into the peer review of health research funding. The studies reviewed had methodological limitations and variable generalisability to research funders. Given these limitations it is not currently possible to recommend immediate implementation of these innovations. However, many appear promising based on existing evidence, and could be adapted as necessary by funders and evaluated. Where feasible, experimental evaluation, including randomised controlled trials, should be conducted, evaluating impact on effectiveness, efficiency and quality.},

Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 664 firms from selected 20 emerging markets during the period of 2006â2013, we find that institutional quality has significant impact on R&D investment. The results show that government effectiveness, rule of law, and regularity quality have positive impact, while corruption and political instability have negative impact on R&D investment in the emerging markets. We also performed elasticity test to compare among the institutional factors. The results show that among the institutional determinants, corruption of a particular emerging country is found to be most important in influencing R&D investment followed by regularity quality, government effectiveness, rule of law, and political instability. These results would be helpful to investors and policy makers to assess the requirements of sustainable development. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that to attract more R&D investment as a source of sustainable development, government should ensure a sound and stable institutional environment along with strengthening other firm level factors as institutional factors are more important to explain the variation over the time and also cost effective in terms of implementation.},

Hypotheses on how business networks and localization are related to innovation performance were tested using principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. The results show that the primary significant factor for innovation performance regarding business networks and localization dimensions are professional network services, while industrial and regional areas also have a positive relationship on product differentiation. Our study also shows that innovation performance enhances firms' abilities to access external financing through professional network services (e.g., venture capital companies).},

abstract = {An enterprise's propensity to innovate has been recognised to have an important bearing on its performance. In Kenya empirical work on micro and small enterprises (MSEs) propensity to innovate is still nascent in spite of the pivotal role played by these enterprises in the economy. The current paper used a Probit econometric model to analyse factors that influence MSE's decision to innovate or not. Results from the analysis show that the average number of years of education for a production worker, physical capital intensity, age of an MSE, access to finance and size of an MSE are important factors influencing MSEs innovation decisions. Higher foreign ownership and manager's experience were found to act as hindrances towards MSEs' decision to innovate. Based on the study findings it is clear that human capital skills and an MSE's resource endowment positively influences MSEs innovativeness.From a theoretical perspective, there is need for skills segmentation to isolate human capital skills that are most relevant for stimulating MSEs innovative activities. Firm level and policy level strategies are also needed to improve the technical skills of the average MSEs' production workers across the country. Subsidisation of physical capital and financial services for MSEs should also be used to promote these enterprises innovativeness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

A variety of factors which hamper, delay or block innovation, so-called barriers, have been researched by a multitude of studies for more than 30 years.

We propose the External environment Organization Group Individual barrier model (EOGI barrier model) aiming at a more encompassing identification of barriers which unites previous findings, acknowledges different level of analysis, and draws on theory (stakeholder theory, managerial levers of dynamic capabilities). The manifestations of innovation barriers identified in the reviewed studies are classified according to the EOGI barrier model: external environment (external stakeholders: investor, potential employee, supplier, competitor, customer, state, society), organization (managerial levers of dynamic capabilities: strategy, structure, size, resources, organizational learning, organizational culture), group (team structure, team climate, team processes, composition of members depending on their characteristics, leadership style), and individual (managers' attitudes and abilities, employees' attitudes and abilities). Additionally, we address strategies to reduce barriers. The research synthesis provides five directions for future research concerning multiple level of analysis, theory-driven sub-categories of each level, interaction of barriers, context specificity of barriers, and origin of the data (level of innovativeness, national culture, differences between developing, newly industrialized and developed countries).},

abstract = {We study the employment and sales growth of entrepreneurial ventures that have received a government-sponsored participative loan (PL), a hybrid form of financing between debt and equity. We use propensity-score matching (PSM) and instrumental variable analysis (2SLS) to study a sample of 512 entrepreneurial ventures that received a PL from a Spanish government agency between 2005 and 2011. We find evidence that PLs significantly boosted their beneficiaries' employment and sales. In the two years following loan issuance, a 1-million-Euro PL generated an increase in average employment of between 12.1 (PSM) and 14.7 (2SLS) units and an increase in sales of between 1.09 and 1.97 million Euro relative to the average for the two years prior to loan issuance. The effect is larger for high-tech, young and small entrepreneurial ventures and for those that received a PL during the global financial crisis. The effect on growth is significant and stable, and PLs increase their beneficiaries' annual growth by 10.6% for employment and by 18.0% for sales. We do not find evidence of industry or regional spillovers, nor do we find differences in the probability of survival of PL beneficiaries after we control for their characteristics.},

abstract = {In recent years, the developed, emerging, and developing economies have prioritized environmental sustainability attainment. In an attempt to offer some potential policy choices towards the achievement of sustainable development, this paper shifts emphasis from the popularly discussed economic development and carbon emissions nexus. Instead, we examine the impact of the banking and financial system's activities on carbon emissions for a sample of 45 countries. These are comprised of developed, emerging, and developing countries between 1990 and 2017. To fill the gap in the literature, the nexus is examined in seven different phases. This study exposes robust and reliable empirical results with the use of Feasible General Least Squares, random effects with regards to the DurbinâWuâHausman test, and Difference General Method of Moments panel data estimation models. Our findings indicate that the increase of domestic credit to the private sector and commercial bank lending consistently contributes towards aggravated carbon emissions in all economic types. Additionally, increased deposit rates in developing economies, increased lending rates in developed economies, and increased deposit rates in emerging economies contribute towards the overall reduction of carbon emissions. The decrease in lending to high GHG emitting members of the private sector by financial institutions in all economies is recommended based on the results of this study.},

The situation of 561 firms in Machines and Equipment industries in Germany was analysed because it is one of the most competitive economy in the world and one of the leaders in innovation within European Union. It allows to create unique benchmark and to propose implications that will be more appropriate and applicable also in other countries. For analyses, the data from Community Innovation Survey 2012â2014, which is a harmonized questionnaire and provides EU's science and technology statistics, was used, and new binary and multiple linear regression models were employed. Results of analyses show that provision of public subsidies, unlike cooperation, strongly influence firm's motivation to innovate. However, results also showed that supported innovation activities do not always lead to an increase in firms' innovative performance. Therefore, it can be pointed to the phenomenon of inefficiency of public innovation support in final consequence.},

abstract = {Purpose: By drawing upon the resource-based view theory, this study investigates the critical resource determinants of start-up companies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in order to encourage the development of entrepreneurship in the region. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach based on multiple linear hierarchical regression analysis was used. Three sets of data were employed. Firstly, the study used the World Bank's Doing Business Report which investigated the ease of starting businesses, access to electricity and access to credit across the 23 MENA countries. Secondly, the study also used the human capital index from the Global Entrepreneurship Index as one of the predictor variables of start-ups. Finally, three specific data sets, namely population, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Gross Domestic Product of the 23 MENA countries were used as control variables due to their importance as determinants of entrepreneurship orientation. Findings: The results of this study indicate that access to two critical resources, namely electricity and credit, have greatly contributed to the formation of start-ups in the MENA region. However, the current level of human capital in the region does not support entrepreneurial activity, hence its inability to support entrepreneurs in the venture creation process. There is a need to augment entrepreneurship education across the region, as well as the provision of entrepreneurial skill development to current and potential entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the study depended heavily on secondary data to examine the determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. Even though the sources of these data are credible, it is impossible to determine any anomalies in the original data. Secondly, the model used in this study is parsimonious in the sense that many more predictor variables could have been explored in understanding the determinants of start-ups in the region. Future research could therefore investigate other factors, such as technology, property rights, the legal system and other important factors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the MENA region. Originality/value: Start-ups are a major source of new employment in a country. However, it is essential to understand the various factors which foster their survival and growth. Even though similar studies have been conducted in various settings, this is one of the few studies which have focused on empirical investigation into the resource determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. The MENA region is noted for its access to abundant oil reserves and other resources. However, this has not culminated in the emergence of successful start-ups. This is what has necessitated this study; to investigate the factors that are responsible for start-up growth in the region. The uniqueness of this study is that it is one of the few studies which have used a three-factor construct in investigating the drivers of start-ups in the MNEA region. This study adopts an exhaustive approach with different variables in different levels of analysis which can provide extra information for further comparative study.},

They create new employment, fulfill the market gap, contribute to Gross Domestic Product and boost the whole economy. However, small-and medium-sized enterprises face more financial constraints than large enterprises, which prevent them from growing and expanding their activities. This paper aims to investigate how the innovation of small-and medium-sized enterprises impacts on credit accessibility in Vietnam from 2005 to 2015, through five aspects of innovation: new products, new technology, improved existing products, research and development investment, and machine innovation. The data set consists of more than 4500 observations of small-and medium-sized enterprises in Vietnam. This data set is taken from a survey conducted within the framework of cooperation among UNU-WIDER, the University of Copenhagen and Vietnamese government agencies. Using panel regression model, we found out that three out of five innovation factors significantly impact on credit accessibility. More specifically, research and development investment and new product have negative impact on credit accessibility; whereas new technology has positive impact on credit accessibility. These findings are useful for firm managers, banks and policy makers to help small-and medium-sized enterprises overcome financial constraints through innovation aspects.},

abstract = {Motivation: Small and medium-sized enterprises, due to their large number, play an important role in the development of the Polish economy. Therefore, the focus should be on creating the right frameworks for their functioning - they should allow them to develop and stimulate the implementation of innovative solutions. Business support organizations (BSOs) are one of the entities that can facilitate development ant stimulation. The main types of BSOs in Poland are: technological parks and incubators, academic business incubators, centers for technology transfer, business angels networks, local/regional load funds, credit guarantee funds, and training and consulting centers. These entities should contribute to the implementation of new solutions in the surveyed enterprises and improve their competitive position. Aim: The aim of the article is to identify impact of business support organization on the innovation activity in industrial enterprises in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The research hypothesis is the claim that BSOs increase the odds of implementation of new products and process in enterprises, but their impact will be different. The hypothesis will be validated on a sample of 442 small and medium-sized, manufacturing companies, which are located in Greater Poland Voivodeship. To carry out the study a multi-factor logit regression method will be used. Results: The research hypothesis is confirmed - BSOs increase the chances on innovation activity but their influence is different. Most effective are training and consulting centers and financing organizations, but this institution stimulate the implementation of new products and processes on the scale of the enterprise and innovation centers (technology parks, academic business incubators and technology transfer offices) of the country.},

According to economic theory, investments should be distinguished by their degree of uncertainty, e.g. routine R&D versus cutting-edge R&D. Financial constraints should be more binding for cutting-edge R&D than for routine R&D. Using panel data we find that R&D spending of firms devoting a significant fraction of R&D to cutting-edge projects is curtailed by credit constraints while routine R&D investments are not. This has important policy implications with respect to the distribution of R&D subsidies in the economy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) contribute to the national economy in terms of employment, added value, knowledge generation, and innovation. However, their potential and in the case of economic downturns even their survival is affected by the difficulties in their access to external financing under acceptable terms and adequate timing and amount. In the case of asymmetric information problems, which make SMEs more sensitive to financial market imperfections, trade credit can be a valuable source of financing. In the European Union, trade credit is among the most relevant external funding sources and it is among the most important alternatives to financial intermediaries' financing. However, there are substantial differences between the countries with respect to availability and use of trade credit. Therefore, this research examines determining (company-specific and country-specific) factors behind the use of trade credit as a financing source in Croatia. The empirical analysis is based on the data for 1,225 SMEs operating in Croatia in the period from 2008 to 2017 and is done using the panel data methodology. The findings confirm that firms' characteristics, as well as the characteristics of financial, macroeconomic and legal environment in which the firms operate, influence the use of trade credit in SMEs in Croatia. The paper contributes to relatively scarce empirical evidence on the determinants of trade credit use by SMEs in South-East European countries.Mala i srednja poduze{\'{c}}a (SME) doprinose nacionalnom gospodarstvu u smislu zaposlenosti, dodane vrijednosti, znanja i inovacija.

Currently, asymmetric processes are observed not only in the interaction of two strategically important sectors for the economy, but also in the asymmetric nature of the impact of regulatory instruments on the process of their interaction. This is a consequence of a largely non-integrated and disproportionate government policy, which in recent years has been characterized by onesidedness and narrow focus in stimulating and supporting certain sectors and industries. In this regard, the authors carried out a three-level assessment of dependencies to determine the degree of influence of innovation activity on the rate of economic growth, the degree of influence of financial-credit organizations on the results of innovation activity and the degree of influence of the current regulatory instruments on the investment activity of the financial sector. As a result of the construction and use of an econometric model, results were obtained that confirm the hypothesis formulated by the authors about the creative role of systemic regulation, but also reveal the existing potential and points of convergence of financial-credit organizations with the innovative sector of the economy.},

Little attention has been given to measuring the performance and drivers of innovation for improvement of smallholder dairying in Malawi. Without understanding innovation, it is difficult to make policies and provide targeted, impactful support to smallholder farmers. This study is based on a cross sectional survey of 193 smallholder farmers in Lilongwe and Blantyre milk shed areas of Malawi. Innovation indices were computed to measure the innovation performance and further analysed to determine the drivers and barriers of innovations. Four categories of innovations namely; feeding, breeding, market, and animal health innovations are presented. The innovation index for the smallholder farmers was less than half (0.37) which is relatively lower in comparison to developed industries. The key driver was access to credit along with training, access to information and networking. For efficient and sustainable management of innovations, clear policies should be put in place to ensure formal structures for supporting continuity of innovations through enhancements in social networking among the farmers and cost effective mechanisms for accessing quality inputs.},

We find evidence that PLs significantly boosted their beneficiaries' employment and sales. In the two years following loan issuance, a 1-million-Euro PL generated an increase in average employment of between 12.1 (PSM) and 14.7 (2SLS) units and an increase in sales of between 1.09 and 1.97 million Euro relative to the average for the two years prior to loan issuance. The effect is larger for high-tech, young and small entrepreneurial ventures and for those that received a PL during the global financial crisis. The effect on growth is significant and stable, and PLs increase their beneficiaries' annual growth by 10.6% for employment and by 18.0% for sales. We do not find evidence of industry or regional spillovers, nor do we find differences in the probability of survival of PL beneficiaries after we control for their characteristics.},

Based on data of Chinese listed companies from 2003 to 2016, this study, firstly, compares the impact of government and private VC on enterprise innovation using Possion regression, and applies the ITCV method and Negative Binomial Regression for Robustness Examination, then, explores the relationship between their shareholding percentage and enterprise innovation with threshold test. The results show that: the performance of private VC is significantly positive and in line. With the increasing shareholding percentage of private VC, the innovation of invested enterprises increases. The overall performance of government VC, however, is not significant, and the shareholding percentage of government VC also has no significant impact on the innovation of invested companies. Additional testing revealed that a âthreshold effectâ however exists in the impact of the shareholding percentage of government VC on innovation: within a certain range, the higher the shareholding percentage, the more significant the impact on innovations becomes, but beyond that range, the percentage is inversely related to innovation.},

abstract = {Institutional environment of a country plays an important role for innovation activities. Our results confirm that external environment of emerging countries influence the R&D investment. Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 664 firms from selected 20 emerging markets during the period of 2006â2013, we find that institutional quality has significant impact on R&D investment. The results show that government effectiveness, rule of law, and regularity quality have positive impact, while corruption and political instability have negative impact on R&D investment in the emerging markets. We also performed elasticity test to compare among the institutional factors. The results show that among the institutional determinants, corruption of a particular emerging country is found to be most important in influencing R&D investment followed by regularity quality, government effectiveness, rule of law, and political instability. These results would be helpful to investors and policy makers to assess the requirements of sustainable development. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that to attract more R&D investment as a source of sustainable development, government should ensure a sound and stable institutional environment along with strengthening other firm level factors as institutional factors are more important to explain the variation over the time and also cost effective in terms of implementation.},

abstract = {In the implementation of decentralization, the Special Allocation Fund (DAK) for health is given to certain areas of Indonesia to support health financing. The performance of this financing, along with national health development priorities' achievements, is illustrated through the indicators of coverage of deliveries in health care facilities (PF) and coverage of first neonatal visits (KN1). Yearly increases in the health DAK budget have not been accompanied by increases in these coverages, and there are still significant disparities between regions. Using secondary data at the district/city level for 2014-2017, this study aims to investigate the impact of health DAK on coverage of PF and KN1. The analytical method deployed is linear regression of panel data using a fixed-effects model. The results show that in the short term, health DAK has a positive but insignificant effect on PF and KN1 coverage. However, health DAK has a positive and significant impact on PF coverage in the second year. Impact on KN1 coverage is unfeasible, even over a period of two years. These results indicate that the processes of planning, budgeting, and administering of health DAK require improvement so that benefits can be felt in the short term through better innovations in health programs. Nevertheless, given that our findings are based on a short period of study, the results from such analyses should consequently be treated with the utmost caution Therefore, future research should target a longer period of data collection to detect more trusty lagged effects and structural breaks of a policy intervention.},

Bibliographic analysis of relevant articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection was performed using Vosviewer. The bibliometric results show the prominent publication outlets, authoritative scholars and items, dominant higher learning institutions, and countries. Still, selected articles were content analyzed, providing a summary of the publications, the methodology adopted, country and period covered. The papers were classified into different themes based on the study focus, thus pinpointing areas that have received more or less scholarly attention. The identified gaps from both bibliographic and content analysis offer future research opportunities in different aspects touching on business innovation, how its financed and related policy issues.

abstract = {Purpose: By drawing upon the resource-based view theory, this study investigates the critical resource determinants of start-up companies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in order to encourage the development of entrepreneurship in the region. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach based on multiple linear hierarchical regression analysis was used. Three sets of data were employed. Firstly, the study used the World Bank's Doing Business Report which investigated the ease of starting businesses, access to electricity and access to credit across the 23 MENA countries. Secondly, the study also used the human capital index from the Global Entrepreneurship Index as one of the predictor variables of start-ups. Finally, three specific data sets, namely population, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Gross Domestic Product of the 23 MENA countries were used as control variables due to their importance as determinants of entrepreneurship orientation. Findings: The results of this study indicate that access to two critical resources, namely electricity and credit, have greatly contributed to the formation of start-ups in the MENA region. However, the current level of human capital in the region does not support entrepreneurial activity, hence its inability to support entrepreneurs in the venture creation process. There is a need to augment entrepreneurship education across the region, as well as the provision of entrepreneurial skill development to current and potential entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the study depended heavily on secondary data to examine the determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. Even though the sources of these data are credible, it is impossible to determine any anomalies in the original data. Secondly, the model used in this study is parsimonious in the sense that many more predictor variables could have been explored in understanding the determinants of start-ups in the region. Future research could therefore investigate other factors, such as technology, property rights, the legal system and other important factors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the MENA region. Originality/value: Start-ups are a major source of new employment in a country. However, it is essential to understand the various factors which foster their survival and growth. Even though similar studies have been conducted in various settings, this is one of the few studies which have focused on empirical investigation into the resource determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. The MENA region is noted for its access to abundant oil reserves and other resources. However, this has not culminated in the emergence of successful start-ups. This is what has necessitated this study; to investigate the factors that are responsible for start-up growth in the region. The uniqueness of this study is that it is one of the few studies which have used a three-factor construct in investigating the drivers of start-ups in the MNEA region. This study adopts an exhaustive approach with different variables in different levels of analysis which can provide extra information for further comparative study.},

abstract = {This article uses a multiple regression model to evaluate the extent to which financial resources in various regions can be put into the most appropriate direction through the financial system or financial market. This paper uses the Tobit model to conduct empirical analysis on the input and output data of technology finance in multiple provinces and cities and explores the impact of various factors on technology finance efficiency from the perspective of three technology finance entities: high-tech enterprises, governments, and venture capital companies. Based on the DEA model and Malmquist index model in the data envelopment analysis method, this paper uses deap software to calculate the efficiency of agricultural science and technology resource allocation in Gansu Province and the efficiency of agricultural science and technology operation in many provinces in the western region. This paper divides the allocation of scientific and technological innovation resources into the ability to allocate scientific and technological innovation resources and the allocation efficiency of scientific and technological innovation resources. By constructing a performance evaluation system for the allocation of scientific and technological innovation resources, it is found that there are obvious differences in the ability and efficiency of scientific and technological innovation resource allocation in various regions. This paper proposes the selected efficiency evaluation method, the multiple regression model, which uses the data from 2012 to 2018 to evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of scientific and technological financial resources in my country, calculates the efficiency value of each region, and conducts a comparative analysis of provinces and regions. Research shows that, through multiple regression model analysis, the total technical efficiency of technology finance in Northeast China rose from 0.759 fluctuations in 2012 to 0.922 in 2018, gradually reducing the difference with the eastern and western regions. The overall promotion plays a significant role. The innovation of this article lies in the use of multiple regression models to analyze the factors affecting the allocation of regional scientific and technological financial resources, aiming to improve the efficiency of financial resource allocation.},

This is a distinctive feature of this paper as most of previous studies had to rely on proxies (like the cash-flow sensitivity), which may be subject to interpretation problems. The probability to have innovative activities and the probability to face financial constraints are simultaneously estimated by a recursive bivariate probit model.Accounting for the endogeneity of the financial constraint variable, we find that financial constraints significantly reduce the likelihood that firms have innovative activities. The probability to encounter financial constraints is explained by firms' ex ante financing structure and economic performances.},

Our estimation results, based on the system-GMM method, show that used credit lines have a positive and significant impact on R&D investments. In addition, we find that this impact is more pronounced for small and young firms than for large and mature firms. These results show that firms use credit lines as part of their liquidity management tools for supporting their R&D investments. Finally, we provide evidence that European firms in bank-based countries increased their use of credit lines for financing their R&D investments during the financial crisis of 2007â2009, while the link between R&D investments and used credit lines became weaker during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010â2013.},

The article shows how in the case of innovation, successful policies that have led to radical innovations have been more about market shaping and creating through direct and pervasive public financing, rather than market fixing. The paper reviews and discusses evidence for this in three key areas: (i) the presence of finance from public sources across the entire innovation chain; (ii) the concept of 'mission-oriented' policies that have created new technological and industrial landscapes; and (iii) the entrepreneurial and lead investor role of public actors, willing and able to take on extreme risks, independent of the business cycle. We further illustrate these three characteristics for the case of clean technology, and discuss how a market-creating and -shaping perspective may be useful for understanding the financing of transformative innovation needed for confronting contemporary societal challenges.},

Subsequently, a propensity score weighting (PSW) analysis is performed to adjust for diversity existing across innovative SMEs. The resulting propensity scores are further used to perform the causal effect analysis based on the average treatment effect (ATE) approach, which measures the likelihood of formal finance usage among different types of innovative SMEs. Our ATE results reveal that SMEs simultaneously engaged in product and process innovation show a higher likelihood of using formal finance than non-innovators. However, formal finance usage of SMEs perusing only product/service or process innovation is not any different from non-innovators. Furthermore, our pairwise analysis shows that product and process innovators also exhibit a higher likelihood of formal finance usage than product/service or process innovators. Besides, younger and medium-size product and process innovating SMEs are more likely to use formal finance. These results are robust for different subsamples and firm- and country-level controls.},

By disaggregating policy designs, we are better able to understand the features of policies (e.g., instrument type, regulatory target, built-in flexibility) associated with effectiveness and the trade offs different features create among evaluation criteria.

abstract = {Green technology innovation is regarded as an important means to achieve sustainable development. Countries all over the world mainly implement green technology innovation policies from the aspects of environmental regulation and financing constraints. The effect of financing constraint policy on enterprise green technology innovation remains to be investigated. Based on the event of âgreen credit guidelinesâ issued by China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012, this paper collects the panel data of China's 2825 listed companies from 2007 to 2018, constructs a difference-in-difference model, and studies the impact of green credit guidelines on corporate green technology innovation and its mechanism. The empirical results show: First, green credit guidelines can promote corporate green technology innovation on the whole. Second, the mechanism of green credit on enterprise green technology innovation is identified. Green credit guidelines mainly limited green technology innovation through reducing debt financing, rather than through financing constraints. Third, the impact of green credit guidelines on green technology innovation is heterogeneous. Green credit guidelines have a significant effect on the green technology innovation of state-owned and large enterprises, but have no effect on the green technology innovation of non-state-owned and small ones.},

This research aims to evaluate the effect of determinants proposed by these three approaches on the occurrence of persistence in the imitation of innovations in products in manufacturing industries. To achieving this goal are used research data from three surveys of innovation and technological development of Colombia (EDIT) and one zero inflate ordered probit models is estimated (ZIOP). The results obtained show that sunk costs do not explain the persistence imitation. On the other hand, the continuous access to internal and external financial resources are essentials for this persistence. Finally, the capabilities approach, which is associated with learning forms indicates that interacting lerning and training explain the ocurrence of persistence in the imitation of innovations in products.},

abstract = {Despite the efforts to enhance adoption of innovative technologies (IT) by the Tunisian Government through national and/or international development projects, the potential rate of adoption of these technologies has remained low among farmers. This study aims at shedding some light on the potential factors that influence IT adoption in the Tunisian arid areas. Technological, economic, institutional factors and human specific factors (social) are selected to be the determinants of agricultural technology adoption. A quantitative approach employing a cross-sectional design was used to gather data. Stratified random sampling was employed and a total of 200 small-scale farmers (100 adopters and 100 non-adopters) were sampled. Data analysis and assessment was done through descriptive and statistical inferential analysis, and econometric modeling using the binary logistic regression model. Empirical findings show that economic and socio-demographic factors such as farmer education, size of cattle flocks and off-farm income were statistically significant and had positive influence on technology adoption while age and farmer experience had significant and negative effects on IT adoption. The findings confirm the important role of institutional factors (being a member of an association, benefiting from extension services and source of technology knowledge) in the adoption decision of IT, particularly when such variables were found to be significant and positives. In contrast, labor and credit services do not significantly influence adoption of IT. Based on these results, Government should focus on educating young farmers with large cattle flock size and off-farm income to enhance the adoption of IT for livestock holders. It should also intensify training programs for farmers and for extension agents with the collaboration of the project managers and the involvement of the profession and the private sector. Finally, the open innovation strategy including all stakeholders during idea generation could be considered as a better way to decrease technology development costs and improve IT adoption.},

Yet, they consistently encounter several constraints such as financing, which impede innovation, growth and internationalisation. This paper examines the external finance-innovation nexus for SMEs operating in five non-oil Arab countriesâEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. To achieve this, a probit regression with instrumental variables is applied to firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. The primary findings reveal that the external finance providers are more likely to be reluctant to fund SMEs' innovation; yet, it thrives with finance. The findings accord with the hypothesis that the accessibility to external funds is a mainstay of SMEs' innovation. There is a need to develop policies that support equity and debt capitals for innovative SMEs.},

Knowledge on the nature, degree and frequency of innovations provide opportunities for supporting the competitive advantages of smallholder dairy farmers to sustainably break away from the poverty cycle. Little attention has been given to measuring the performance and drivers of innovation for improvement of smallholder dairying in Malawi. Without understanding innovation, it is difficult to make policies and provide targeted, impactful support to smallholder farmers. This study is based on a cross sectional survey of 193 smallholder farmers in Lilongwe and Blantyre milk shed areas of Malawi. Innovation indices were computed to measure the innovation performance and further analysed to determine the drivers and barriers of innovations. Four categories of innovations namely; feeding, breeding, market, and animal health innovations are presented. The innovation index for the smallholder farmers was less than half (0.37) which is relatively lower in comparison to developed industries. The key driver was access to credit along with training, access to information and networking. For efficient and sustainable management of innovations, clear policies should be put in place to ensure formal structures for supporting continuity of innovations through enhancements in social networking among the farmers and cost effective mechanisms for accessing quality inputs.},

Five-hundred and fifty (550) SME owners were randomly selected for the study. Information was sourced through the use of questionnaires. Tobit model was used for the analysis. Sales value of new products was used a proxy for new products innovation. The determinants were grouped into two types thus innovation expenditure and sources of innovation expenditure. Sources of innovation expenditure have significant influence on new products innovation. From the finding foreign capital, government tax credit, and subsidies had significantly influence on new products innovation. SMEs specific attributes such as patent and having overseas partners influence new product innovation.Policies and programs geared towards government tax credit, subsidies, patent rights and inflow of foreign capital into SME sector should be encouraged since they have the potential of promoting product innovation in the sector.

Employing the dataset from China-Enterprise Survey 2012 of the World Bank, this study tests the impact of financial constraints on firms' R & D investment and the moderating role of CEO characteristics. Empirical results show that: (1) firm's financial constraints have a significant restricting effect on their R & D investment; (2) internal financial constraints have no significant restricting effect on R & D investment for firms with female CEOs in comparison with firms with male CEOs, while the external financial constraints have a significant restricting effect on R & D investment for both groups. (3) CEO experience has a non-linear moderating effect on the relationship between financial constraints and a firm's R & D investment. When the accumulated experience is overloaded, the positive moderating effect of CEO experience begins to decline and even become negative. Robustness tests further confirm these empirical findings. This study directly contributes to the literature of financing innovation and top management team's impact on firms' sustainable innovation, and generates insights on firms' R & D management under the condition of financial constraints.},

In U.S. environmental markets, early action could reduce lags in environmental performance, improve outcomes, and encourage innovation in mitigation approaches. Multiple tools have emerged for encouraging early action in environmental markets. Several tools have also been deployed in markets, providing valuable insight into their function. This paper presents a systematic review of early action tools and describes their use in wetland and stream mitigation, species and habitat banking, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water quality trading. It finds that incentives necessary to motivate sellers differ from those motivating buyers. The tool or approach best suited to encourage early action also varies as conditions change. Anecdotal evidence suggests the potential for benefits to accrue from early action, but additional data are needed to inform the use of specific tools.},

Also, it has played a significant role in business ecosystem, and the achievement of science and technology have greatly spread to the development of both local and global firms. However, there are factors that discourage the applicable capabilities of such innovations on business processes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degrees of barriers which block the use of innovation in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam namely human resources, access to finance, transparency, tax rates, trade regulations and customs. The secondary data used were gathered from Enterprise survey (ES) of 479 small and medium enterprises in five different regions (Red River Delta, North Central Coast, Central Coast Area, South East and Mekong River Delta), which are conducted by the World Bank Group from 2015 to 2017. The binary logistic regression and Logit Model were used to process variables and data analysis. The major findings revealed that barriers of accessing financial capacity, trading regulations and customs have positively affected on innovation of SMEs in Vietnam. Finally, it could be emphasized that HR training has the strongest impact on innovation changes of the enterprises by 55.7%.},

Drawing on institutional theory and using panel data of generalized methods of moment estimation for a sample of 302 firms from 20 countries during the period 2003â2015, we find that emerging market firms tend to use internal funds for financing R&D investments. Interesting results emerged when the sample was divided as alliance and non-alliance firms, and bank-based and market-based financial systems. The results show that R&D financing behaves differently for alliance and non-alliance firms. Alliance firms use both internal and external funds for R&D investments, while non-alliance firms do not use external funds. We also document that a country's financial system influences the choice of available sources of finance. Firms from countries that follow a bank-based financial system tend to rely on external funds while firms from countries that follow a market-based financial system depend more on internal funds for financing R&D investments. This study is important as it provides new evidence on financing R&D investments in emerging countries taking into account the institutional arguments of financing choices, and so should guide stakeholders about appropriate sources of R&D financing.},

abstract = {Innovation capability of enterprises will greatly influence the current and future development of companies. This paper investigates the relationship between customer concentration and innovation capability of enterprises through the view of both the financing constraints and the expectation of managers. Based on the data of China's A-share listed companies over the period from 2012 to 2016, several methods including system GMM, threshold model of fixed effects, and PSM are applied for empirical analysis. The results show that the innovation capability of listed companies in China are negatively correlated with the customer concentration. Higher customer concentration brings about stronger constraints from large customers on enterprises and greater dependence of enterprises on large customers, which result in weaker demand for innovation and lower investment in innovation. Meanwhile, the results demonstrate the double-threshold effect of financing constraints. The effect of customer concentration on innovation can be different in companies with low, medium, or high-financing constraints. Furthermore, optimistic expectations are more conducive to the reduction of customer concentration and the improvement of innovation. In addition, based on the perspective of the manager's expectation, the research demonstrates the heterogeneous impact of manager's expectation on the relationship between customer concentration and innovation capability.},

Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 664 firms from selected 20 emerging markets during the period of 2006â2013, we find that institutional quality has significant impact on R&D investment. The results show that government effectiveness, rule of law, and regularity quality have positive impact, while corruption and political instability have negative impact on R&D investment in the emerging markets. We also performed elasticity test to compare among the institutional factors. The results show that among the institutional determinants, corruption of a particular emerging country is found to be most important in influencing R&D investment followed by regularity quality, government effectiveness, rule of law, and political instability. These results would be helpful to investors and policy makers to assess the requirements of sustainable development. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that to attract more R&D investment as a source of sustainable development, government should ensure a sound and stable institutional environment along with strengthening other firm level factors as institutional factors are more important to explain the variation over the time and also cost effective in terms of implementation.},

Currently, asymmetric processes are observed not only in the interaction of two strategically important sectors for the economy, but also in the asymmetric nature of the impact of regulatory instruments on the process of their interaction. This is a consequence of a largely non-integrated and disproportionate government policy, which in recent years has been characterized by onesidedness and narrow focus in stimulating and supporting certain sectors and industries. In this regard, the authors carried out a three-level assessment of dependencies to determine the degree of influence of innovation activity on the rate of economic growth, the degree of influence of financial-credit organizations on the results of innovation activity and the degree of influence of the current regulatory instruments on the investment activity of the financial sector. As a result of the construction and use of an econometric model, results were obtained that confirm the hypothesis formulated by the authors about the creative role of systemic regulation, but also reveal the existing potential and points of convergence of financial-credit organizations with the innovative sector of the economy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES OF THE REVIEW Business support interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) direct a large amount of resources to SMEs, with the assumption that institutional constraints impede small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from generating profits and employment at the firm level, which in turn is thought to impede economic growth and poverty reduction. Yet despite this abundance of resources, very little is known about the impact of such interventions. To address this gap, this systematic review analyses evaluations of SME support services in LMICs to help inform policy debates pertaining to SMEs and business support services. This review examines the available evidence on the effects of SME support services in LMICs on firm-level performance indicators (such as revenues, profits, and productivity), employment generation, and labour productivity. METHODS We systematically searched for available literature. To identify relevant papers for this review, we conducted electronic searches on key platforms; snowball sampling of references from relevant papers and book chapters, and suggestions from recognized experts in the field. We focused on LMICs as defined by the World Bank classifications, and on evidence published since the year 2000, so as to include more sophisticated evaluation techniques. The references retrieved for this review are up-to-date as of December 2014. We included studies that evaluated the effectiveness of business support services on firm level outcomes of SMEs in low- and middle-income countries. We defined SMEs as firms with between two and 250 employees, but also included studies that used annual revenue to classify firms as SMEs instead of employee count. We examined interventions involving tax simplification, exports and access to external markets; support for innovation policies; support to local production systems; training and technical assistance, and SME financing and credit guarantee programmes. We looked at studies documenting the impact of any business support service on SMEs when compared with business as usual. We included studies that report at least one final outcome of interest (such as higher profits, employment generation, and productivity). We incorporated studies that use experimental and quasi-experimental methods, and other studies purporting to control for selection bias and endogeneity in selection into the programme. The search results were screened by two review researchers, and the included studies were similarly coded by two researchers. This double-review process was designed to make the selection procedure and coding more rigorous and to screen for mistakes. We coded the data according to the impacts and characteristics of the studies selected. Standardised mean difference was used to code continuous variable outcomes and risk ratios to code binary variables outcomes. Effect sizes were synthesised and summarised to one effect size per outcome per study. Given the heterogeneity of true effects, we used analyses of random effects models to estimate overall average standardised effects. Moderator analysis was conducted with four additional variables. RESULTS The initial search returned 9,475 studies, which after dropping duplicates and applying the selection criteria were reduced to a final sample of 40 studies. These consisted of 37 papers (23 peer reviewed and 20 working papers), and 6 book chapters. All were produced between 2003 and 2014. Four of these studies could not be included in the meta-analysis as incomplete information prevented us from computing standardised measures. The review reports 242 effect sizes (ES), and the meta-analysis is based on 72 ES; 64 continuous and eight binary outcomes. Overall, our findings indicate that: Business support to SMEs improves firms' performance (average ES of 0.13 standard deviations (SD) and confidence interval (CI) (0.06, 0.20)), helps create jobs (average ES of 0.15 SD and CI (0.08, 0.22)), has a positive effect on labour productivity (average ES of 0.11 SD and CI (0.08, 0.15)), on exports (average ES of 0.04 and CI (0.01, 0.06)) and on firms' investment (average ES of 0.13 SD and CI (0.02, 0.24)). Evidence on their effects on innovation by SMEs is less clear (average ES of 0.05 SD and CI (-0.01, 0.12). When the analysis is disaggregated by type of intervention, we find that matching grants continue to show a positive impact on firms' performance and employment of similar magnitude and precision once we exclude some outliers. Excluding the outliers, the average ES for these two outcomes are 0.15 SD (with CI (0.08, 0.22)) and 0.14 SD (with CI (0.03, 0.24)) respectively. Even though they are based on only few studies, results from meta-regression indicate that technical assistance programmes have some positive effects on firms' performance, jobs creation and labour productivity, whereas tax simplification programmes seem to improve firm performance and generate jobs. Export promotion and innovation programmes seem to positively affect exports and innovation respectively, but do not seem to have an effect firm performance and employment creation outcomes. The average ES are extremely low and very imprecisely estimated. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND RESEARCH Our findings suggest that, overall, SME support has a positive impact on firm performance indicators. The results of our review should not be interpreted as clear evidence of SME support effectiveness, however, as the meta-analysis was unable to provide results for all types of interventions or for specific countries. There was also significant risk of bias in many studies. Most of the studies found relate to Latin America, and thus cannot be interpreted as being applicable to other regions, including Africa. We recommend further analysis of cost-effectiveness, as most studies do not indicate the cost of implementation. There remains a paucity of rigorous evaluation studies on SME support programmes in Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular. Therefore, the generation of more evidence for the African context is paramount to the improved understanding of the role SME support programmes might play in the development process.},

abstract = {This study empirically examined the impact of financing innovation on technological innovation efficiency of select internet companies, that were affiliated with China between 2008 and 2017. Analysis was based on their patent and annual report data and used multiple input-output SFA model, system GMM, and panel fixed-effect model. The results are as follows. (1) There is significant variation in overall technological innovation efficiency of listed companies in the internet industry, and there is a downward trend. The technological innovation efficiency of business that use financing innovation methods is higher than those that do not. (2) The number of patents and intangible capital investment of internet businesses increase obviously every year, but there is no corresponding increase in the efficiency of technological innovation, and little intangible capital investment of non-financing innovation businesses. Thus, determining how to effectively improve the overall quality of patents and the efficiency of intangible capital investment is essential to improve the efficiency of technological innovation for Chinese internet businesses. (3) There is a term mismatch in the investment and financing of internet businesses in China. The financing structure between the financing innovation and non-financing innovation businesses has different impacts on the efficiency of technological innovation. And nowadays, more financing channels are short-term debt financing channels which invest in projects to improve the efficiency of technological innovation due to the pressure of debt repayment and the need to protect shareholders' interests. (4) In the panel regression, the coefficients of Icd and Roa are significantly negative, suggesting that the investment efficiency of internet businesses needs to be improved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The sample comprised data for 75 developed and developing countries for the period 1996 to 2010. An inverted U-shaped non-linear relationship between finance and innovation was observed. This finding implies that finance enhances innovation only up to a certain level. Beyond that level, further development of finance tends to affect innovation adversely. The institution interaction term was included to examine its role in the relationship between finance and innovation. The results suggest that the finance-innovation curve varies with different settings of institutional quality. Specifically, the finance-innovation relationships followed an inverted U curve only for countries with high institutional quality. Hence, sound institutional quality is a prerequisite for financial development to benefit innovation.},

Using panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2003 to 2015, this study examines the impact of rural financial development on agricultural technology innovation from the perspective of rural financial scale and rural finance efficiency. Furthermore, it examines how the effects of rural financial development vary in regions with different levels of marketization and economic development. The empirical results show that the development of rural finance has a significant and positive effect on the level of agricultural technology innovation. Rural finance efficiency has a significantly positive effect on innovation in regions with a low degree of marketization, while the rural financial scale has a significantly positive effect on technological innovation in regions with a high degree of marketization. Further analysis showed that improving the level of agricultural technology innovation is conducive to rural economic development. This study provides new insights into the effects of rural financial development on sustainable agricultural development from the perspective of agricultural technology innovation.},

This research aims to evaluate the effect of determinants proposed by these three approaches on the occurrence of persistence in the imitation of innovations in products in manufacturing industries. To achieving this goal are used research data from three surveys of innovation and technological development of Colombia (EDIT) and one zero inflate ordered probit models is estimated (ZIOP). The results obtained show that sunk costs do not explain the persistence imitation. On the other hand, the continuous access to internal and external financial resources are essentials for this persistence. Finally, the capabilities approach, which is associated with learning forms indicates that interacting lerning and training explain the ocurrence of persistence in the imitation of innovations in products.},

This article aims to explore scientific literature on innovation and entrepreneurship in the academic setting, describing how the field is organized, main terms and definitions, theoretical frameworks, and empirical models, in order to direct future research. A systematic literature review was conducted, in which articles indexed at Web of Science were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Then, the content of a set of articles best fitting the objectives of the study was analyzed. Bibliometric analysis shows an increasing literature, with publications over more than 40Â years. There are studies from many disciplines, with those in business and economics prevailing, mainly related to management and originating from the USA and Europe. Content analysis shows a fragmented literature, with definitions not showing a clear relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship, or their use within universities in coherence with their traditional definitions. Both theoretical frameworks and empirical models are very heterogeneous, but four groups of studies were identified based on their theoretical frameworks, and also based on their empirical models. With only a few exceptions, empirical models do not share many components and variables, and there are no clear boundaries between the different models. Despite the increasing literature, it is still fragmented and undertheorized, requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship within universities.},

Employing the dataset from China-Enterprise Survey 2012 of the World Bank, this study tests the impact of financial constraints on firms' R & D investment and the moderating role of CEO characteristics. Empirical results show that: (1) firm's financial constraints have a significant restricting effect on their R & D investment; (2) internal financial constraints have no significant restricting effect on R & D investment for firms with female CEOs in comparison with firms with male CEOs, while the external financial constraints have a significant restricting effect on R & D investment for both groups. (3) CEO experience has a non-linear moderating effect on the relationship between financial constraints and a firm's R & D investment. When the accumulated experience is overloaded, the positive moderating effect of CEO experience begins to decline and even become negative. Robustness tests further confirm these empirical findings. This study directly contributes to the literature of financing innovation and top management team's impact on firms' sustainable innovation, and generates insights on firms' R & D management under the condition of financial constraints.},

With Spanish CIS data we find evidence that the three channels contributed to the fall in the proportion of firms that introduce technological innovations during the Great Recession, compared with the proportion of innovators in the years of expansion.

Previous studies emphasized the role of public R&D to encourage the technological innovation in the private sector. However, the effect of global economic crisis with respect to the public and private R&D link has been somewhat neglected in the empirical literature. Based on system GMM estimation, we found that public R&D complements private R&D in pre and post economic crisis. However, the strength of their complementary association is found strong in pre-economic crisis. In sum, the results indicate that continuous support to public R&D in pre and post economic crisis accelerate the technological innovation in the private sector. This study implies that public support to R&D is a good strategy for an economy to confront economic crisis effectively by increasing the technological innovation in the private sector. For policy makers, it is suggested that care must be taken while investing in the R&D, the investment is to be based on the ratio between R&D expenditure to number of R&D workers.},

Our estimation results, based on the system-GMM method, show that used credit lines have a positive and significant impact on R&D investments. In addition, we find that this impact is more pronounced for small and young firms than for large and mature firms. These results show that firms use credit lines as part of their liquidity management tools for supporting their R&D investments. Finally, we provide evidence that European firms in bank-based countries increased their use of credit lines for financing their R&D investments during the financial crisis of 2007â2009, while the link between R&D investments and used credit lines became weaker during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010â2013.},

abstract = {Despite the efforts to enhance adoption of innovative technologies (IT) by the Tunisian Government through national and/or international development projects, the potential rate of adoption of these technologies has remained low among farmers. This study aims at shedding some light on the potential factors that influence IT adoption in the Tunisian arid areas. Technological, economic, institutional factors and human specific factors (social) are selected to be the determinants of agricultural technology adoption. A quantitative approach employing a cross-sectional design was used to gather data. Stratified random sampling was employed and a total of 200 small-scale farmers (100 adopters and 100 non-adopters) were sampled. Data analysis and assessment was done through descriptive and statistical inferential analysis, and econometric modeling using the binary logistic regression model. Empirical findings show that economic and socio-demographic factors such as farmer education, size of cattle flocks and off-farm income were statistically significant and had positive influence on technology adoption while age and farmer experience had significant and negative effects on IT adoption. The findings confirm the important role of institutional factors (being a member of an association, benefiting from extension services and source of technology knowledge) in the adoption decision of IT, particularly when such variables were found to be significant and positives. In contrast, labor and credit services do not significantly influence adoption of IT. Based on these results, Government should focus on educating young farmers with large cattle flock size and off-farm income to enhance the adoption of IT for livestock holders. It should also intensify training programs for farmers and for extension agents with the collaboration of the project managers and the involvement of the profession and the private sector. Finally, the open innovation strategy including all stakeholders during idea generation could be considered as a better way to decrease technology development costs and improve IT adoption.},

abstract = {Motivation: Small and medium-sized enterprises, due to their large number, play an important role in the development of the Polish economy. Therefore, the focus should be on creating the right frameworks for their functioning - they should allow them to develop and stimulate the implementation of innovative solutions. Business support organizations (BSOs) are one of the entities that can facilitate development ant stimulation. The main types of BSOs in Poland are: technological parks and incubators, academic business incubators, centers for technology transfer, business angels networks, local/regional load funds, credit guarantee funds, and training and consulting centers. These entities should contribute to the implementation of new solutions in the surveyed enterprises and improve their competitive position. Aim: The aim of the article is to identify impact of business support organization on the innovation activity in industrial enterprises in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The research hypothesis is the claim that BSOs increase the odds of implementation of new products and process in enterprises, but their impact will be different. The hypothesis will be validated on a sample of 442 small and medium-sized, manufacturing companies, which are located in Greater Poland Voivodeship. To carry out the study a multi-factor logit regression method will be used. Results: The research hypothesis is confirmed - BSOs increase the chances on innovation activity but their influence is different. Most effective are training and consulting centers and financing organizations, but this institution stimulate the implementation of new products and processes on the scale of the enterprise and innovation centers (technology parks, academic business incubators and technology transfer offices) of the country.},

abstract = {This article provides a systematic review of the literature on the complex relationships between intellectual capital, innovation and performance. Although these concepts are clearly intertwined, there has been so far and to the best of our knowledge, no attempt to systematically review and integrate the literature examining the relationships between them. Two main streams of literature emerge: on the one hand, some literature focuses on the economic and financial effects of intellectual capital and its components on performance and on the other hand, a small set of survey-based studies aims to delineate these effects adopting a multidimensional approach to performance. Besides these two streams, there is a wealth of literature exploring the effect of isolated element of human, structural or relational capital on performance. Nevertheless, these studies rarely refer to these concepts directly and it is therefore contended that using the concept of intellectual capital may provide interesting insights to illuminate the complex relationships between firms' resources and activities to leverage its intangible assets, innovation and performance. In doing so, it provides an intellectual capital oriented framework to capture the distinctive features of innovation at firm level and hence contributes to the scarce stream of literature focusing on better identifying and delineating innovation effects on performance.

abstract = {This study examined the non-linear relationship between financial development and innovation using generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators for a panel data model. The sample comprised data for 75 developed and developing countries for the period 1996 to 2010. An inverted U-shaped non-linear relationship between finance and innovation was observed. This finding implies that finance enhances innovation only up to a certain level. Beyond that level, further development of finance tends to affect innovation adversely. The institution interaction term was included to examine its role in the relationship between finance and innovation. The results suggest that the finance-innovation curve varies with different settings of institutional quality. Specifically, the finance-innovation relationships followed an inverted U curve only for countries with high institutional quality. Hence, sound institutional quality is a prerequisite for financial development to benefit innovation.},

@article{Mazzucato2015a,
abstract = {This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both âfinanceâ and âcapital developmentâ very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition â to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge â the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of productionâto complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to âfinancialisation of the real economy,â the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi's famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking âvampire squid.â In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky's ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter's views on financing innovation.},

This is a distinctive feature of this paper as most of previous studies had to rely on proxies (like the cash-flow sensitivity), which may be subject to interpretation problems. The probability to have innovative activities and the probability to face financial constraints are simultaneously estimated by a recursive bivariate probit model.Accounting for the endogeneity of the financial constraint variable, we find that financial constraints significantly reduce the likelihood that firms have innovative activities. The probability to encounter financial constraints is explained by firms' ex ante financing structure and economic performances.},

The purpose of the current paper is to investigate the impact of investments and innovation on territorial economic growth, as measured by turnover, for Romanian active enterprises, especially SMEs, over the period 2009-2017. By estimating several log-log linear regressions, the quantitative outcomes provide support for a positive influence of investments on turnover. The association was confirmed both for all active enterprises at the national level, as well as for micro, small, middle-sized and big companies. As regards expenditures on innovation, a positive impact on turnover was acknowledged for all enterprises and particularly for big companies, but there was an absence of any statistically significant relation in the case of SMEs. The impact of firm size on turnover was positive for all active enterprises at the national level, along with active micro-units. Also, the estimation results show a positive impact of the number of active micro-units on territorial economic growth. The empirical findings are relevant to managers and policymakers in order to stimulate, encourage and offer support to SMEs' development through their strategies.},

And for the impact range, the government subsidies are higher than that of financial institution loans.

abstract = {This study examines factors that increase resilience in innovation of Polish manufacturing firms in an unstable environment. Organizational resilience in innovation is the ability to continuously perform innovation in a turbulent environment and increase knowledge accumulation. In 2008â2012, Poland did not have crisis itself. Short-term slowdown of the economy was accompanied by a breakdown of innovation activities, with a medium-term effect. Based on the Polish Community Innovation Survey panel data for two periods: the innovation crisis (2008â2010), and the innovation pessimism period (2010â2012), this study shows which innovative resources change the probability of innovation continuity in the second period. In our probit model, we explore 42 factors of innovations. We found that financing, R&D and marketing increased the probability of continuity of innovation, but the influence of financing was the strongest. Persistence in innovation in turbulent times hence requires a change in the structure of innovation resources used. Due to the fact that public support on innovation did not increase the likelihood of the continuity of the innovation, a policy change is required. Reliability of our estimation is confirmed by accuracy of prediction of firms, which was 78.2%.},

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of some of the ARRA funds in terms of stimulating innovative activities specifically in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. The research question was about whether federal ARRA expenditures issued through decentralized state and local intergovernmental grant programs and designed to spur new energy technologies effectively achieved their legislatively stated objectives. The analysis was based upon a first differenced regression model with instrumental variables using data from 2005 to 2015. The analytical evidence indicates that all else held equal, the ARRA funds successfully stimulated innovative activities in these technology fields. We conclude that a decentralized delivery system conducted through intergovernmental grants can effectively allocate federal expenditures for promoting innovative activity in energytechnology-related fields. We also suggest that short-term and temporary funds such as those supplied by the ARRA can provide a positive longerterm return vis-a-vis innovative activity in these fields.},

abstract = {Setting off from an Evolutionary perspective, this paper debates key aspects of the process of financing innovation based on Keynes's asset choice model within the context of Minsky's cycle and the Institutionalist approach of Veblen. Innovative activity is surrounded by great uncertainty because firms invest funds for the long term without being sure whether they will earn high returns. As a result, firms run into additional obstacles when trying to obtain financing to develop new technologies. This difference becomes clearer when developed countries (USA) and less-developed countries (Brazil) are compared. The higher the level of uncertainty in world markets, the lower the amount of funds available to finance innovation; and this situation is accentuated in less-developed countries because they do not have a mature financial system capable of supporting innovation risks.},

The primary findings reveal that the external finance providers are more likely to be reluctant to fund SMEs' innovation; yet, it thrives with finance. The findings accord with the hypothesis that the accessibility to external funds is a mainstay of SMEs' innovation.

The effect is larger for high-tech, young and small entrepreneurial ventures and for those that received a PL during the global financial crisis. The effect on growth is significant and stable, and PLs increase their beneficiaries' annual growth by 10.6% for employment and by 18.0% for sales.

In Kenya empirical work on micro and small enterprises (MSEs) propensity to innovate is still nascent in spite of the pivotal role played by these enterprises in the economy. The current paper used a Probit econometric model to analyse factors that influence MSE's decision to innovate or not. Results from the analysis show that the average number of years of education for a production worker, physical capital intensity, age of an MSE, access to finance and size of an MSE are important factors influencing MSEs innovation decisions. Higher foreign ownership and manager's experience were found to act as hindrances towards MSEs' decision to innovate. Based on the study findings it is clear that human capital skills and an MSE's resource endowment positively influences MSEs innovativeness.From a theoretical perspective, there is need for skills segmentation to isolate human capital skills that are most relevant for stimulating MSEs innovative activities. Firm level and policy level strategies are also needed to improve the technical skills of the average MSEs' production workers across the country. Subsidisation of physical capital and financial services for MSEs should also be used to promote these enterprises innovativeness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The empirical results show: First, green credit guidelines can promote corporate green technology innovation on the whole. Second, the mechanism of green credit on enterprise green technology innovation is identified. Green credit guidelines mainly limited green technology innovation through reducing debt financing, rather than through financing constraints. Third, the impact of green credit guidelines on green technology innovation is heterogeneous. Green credit guidelines have a significant effect on the green technology innovation of state-owned and large enterprises, but have no effect on the green technology innovation of non-state-owned and small ones.},

These policies triggered concerns over the impact of debt financing on firms' technological innovation activities. Based on a sample of 225 listed computer and telecommunications equipment firms in China within 2008â2015, this study explored the effect of debt financing on two types of technological innovation, namely radical and incremental innovation. Specifically, both the direct effect of debt financing on technological innovation and its moderating effect on the relationship between R&D intensity and technological innovation were investigated. Results of this study reveal that radical innovation decreases with debt financing at decreasing rates, while incremental innovation is not affected by debt financing itself. In addition, debt financing interacted with R&D intensity exerts positive effect on both radical and incremental innovation. This study adds meaningful insights to the literature on financing technological innovation and builds a bridge connecting macroeconomic policies to firm activities.},

abstract = {Universities play pivotal roles when research findings are to be adopted commercially. Although these roles vary from one country to another, effective patenting and licensing procedures, as well as eventual commercialisation of scholarly inventions, reflect hard work on the part of the University mediating between the researcher and the industry through technology transfer offices (TTOs) in order to ensure that knowledge-developers take motivational and monetary credit for their findings. This paper details some existing models, processes, and roles taken up in some countries where sharing of intellectual property exists, and links it up with aspects of universityâindustry technology transfer, such as policies surrounding patenting, government investment and marketing, and the process of academic entrepreneurship, among others. 22 articles were found via a systematic review of literature and analysed with respect to four identified areas of focus: internal strategy, investment and market, academic entrepreneurship and policy. Based on models, processes, and roles in reviewed studies, our results indicate that new models for technology transfer mainly stem from the fact that there is no universally accepted model in the literature. Furthermore, management of technology transfer is mostly the responsibility of TTOs in most countries. While university TTOs act as intermediaries to protect the interest of the author/inventor, issues such as poor relationships between universities and industry, as well as funding, remain major challenges in many emerging economies. In contrast, researchers in western economies are mainly challenged by financial motivation and recognition within the academic domains.},
